<title>Fields</title>

<introduction>
<p>FIXME: Move content in here</p>
</introduction>

It is natural to ask whether or not some field <m>F</m> is contained in a
larger field.  We think of the rational numbers, which reside inside
the real numbers, while in turn, the real numbers live inside the
complex numbers.  We can also study the fields between <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> and
<m>{\mathbb R}</m> and inquire as to the nature of these fields.

 
More specifically if we are given a field <m>F</m> and a polynomial $p(x)
\in F[x]<m>, we can ask whether or not we can find a field </m>E$
containing <m>F</m> such that <m>p(x)</m> factors into linear factors over
<m>E[x]</m>.  For example, if we consider the polynomial  
<me>
p(x) =x^4 -5 x^2 + 6
</me>
in <m>{\mathbb Q}[x]</m>,  then <m>p(x)</m> factors as <m>(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)</m>.
However, both of these factors are irreducible in <m>{\mathbb Q}[x]</m>.  If
we wish to find a zero of <m>p(x)</m>, we must go to a larger field.
Certainly the field of real numbers will work, since
<me>
p(x) = (x - \sqrt{2} ) (x + \sqrt{2} )( x - \sqrt{3})(x + \sqrt{3}).
</me>
It is possible to find a smaller field in which <m>p(x)</m> has a zero,
namely 
<me>
{\mathbb Q }( \sqrt{2} ) = \{ a + b \sqrt{2} : a, b \in {\mathbb Q} \}. 
</me>
We wish to be able to compute and study such fields for arbitrary 
polynomials over a field <m>F</m>.

<title>Extension Fields</title>

A field <m>E</m> is an <term>extension field</term><index><main>Extension</main><sub>field</sub></index><index><main>Field</main><sub>extension</sub></index> of a field <m>F</m>
if <m>F</m> is a subfield of <m>E</m>. The field <m>F</m> is called the <term>base  field</term><index><main>Field</main><sub>base</sub></index>.  We write <m>F \subset E</m>.

<example xml:id="field_Q_sqrt2">
<p>
For example, let 
<me>
F = {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{2}\,) = \{ a + b \sqrt{2} : a, b \in {\mathbb Q} \}
</me>
and
let
<m>E =  {\mathbb Q }( \sqrt{2} +  \sqrt{3}\,)</m> be the smallest field
containing both <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> and <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m>. Both <m>E</m> and <m>F</m>
are extension fields of the rational numbers. We claim that <m>E</m> is an
extension field of <m>F</m>. To see this, we need only show that <m>\sqrt{2}</m>
is in <m>E</m>. Since <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m> is in <m>E</m>, $1 / (\sqrt{2} +
\sqrt{3}\,) = \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}<m> must also be in </m>E$. Taking linear
combinations of <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m> and <m>\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}</m>, we
find that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and <m>\sqrt{3}</m> must both be in <m>E</m>.
</p>
</example>


<example xml:id="finite_field4">
<p>
Let <m>p(x) = x^2 + x + 1 \in {\mathbb Z}_2[x]</m>. Since neither 0 nor 1 is a
root of this polynomial, we know that <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible over
<m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>. We will construct a field extension of <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>
containing an element <m>\alpha</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>. By
Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="poly:max_ideal_theorem" />, the ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> generated by <m>p(x)</m>
is maximal; hence, <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle</m> is a field. 
Let <m>f(x) + \langle p(x) \rangle</m> be an arbitrary element of
<m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle</m>. By the division algorithm,   
<me>
f(x) = (x^2 + x + 1) q(x) + r(x),
</me>
where the degree of <m>r(x)</m> is less than the degree of <m>x^2 + x + 1</m>.
Therefore, 
<me>
f(x) + \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle = r(x) + \langle x^2 + x + 1
\rangle. 
</me>
The only possibilities for <m>r(x)</m> are then <m>0</m>, <m>1</m>, <m>x</m>, and <m>1+x</m>.
Consequently, <m>E = {\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle</m> is a field
with four elements and must be a field extension of <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>,
containing a zero <m>\alpha</m> of <m>p(x)</m>. The field <m>{\mathbb Z}_2(  \alpha)</m>
consists of elements

0 + 1 \alpha &amp; = \alpha</mrow><mrow>
1 + 1 \alpha &amp; = 1 + \alpha.
</mrow></md>
Notice that <m>{\alpha}^2 + {\alpha} + 1 = 0</m>; hence, if we compute $(1
+ \alpha)^2$,  
<me>
(1 + \alpha)(1 + \alpha)= 1 + \alpha + \alpha + (\alpha)^2 = \alpha. 
</me>
Other calculations are accomplished in a similar manner.  We summarize
these computations in the following tables, which tell us how to add
and multiply elements in <m>E</m>.

The following theorem, due to Kronecker, is so important and so basic 
to our understanding of fields that it is often known as the
Fundamental Theorem of Field Theory.
 

<theorem xml:id="fields:ext_exist_theorem">
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>p(x)</m> be a nonconstant polynomial in
<m>F[x]</m>.  Then there exists an extension field <m>E</m> of <m>F</m> and an 
element <m>\alpha \in E</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>. 
</p>
FIXME-MOVE-IN-PROOF</statement>
</theorem>
 

<proof><p>
To prove this theorem, we will employ the method that we used to
construct Example<nbsp /><xref ref="example:fields:finite_field4" />. Clearly, we can assume that <m>p(x)</m> is an
irreducible polynomial. We wish to find an extension field <m>E</m> of <m>F</m>
containing an element <m>\alpha</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>. The ideal
<m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> generated by <m>p(x)</m> is a maximal ideal in
<m>F[x]</m> by Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="poly:max_ideal_theorem" />; hence, <m>F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is a
field. We claim that <m>E = F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is the desired 
field.  


We first show that <m>E</m> is a field extension of <m>F</m>. We can define a
homomorphism of commutative rings by the map
\mbox{<m>\psi:F \rightarrow F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m>}, where $\psi(a) = a +
\langle p(x)\rangle<m> for </m>a \in F<m>. It is easy to check that </m>\psi$ is
indeed a ring homomorphism.  Observe that 
<me>
\psi( a ) + \psi( b ) = (a + \langle p(x) \rangle) + (b + \langle p(x)
\rangle) = (a + b) + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi( a + b ) 
</me>
and
<me>
\psi( a )  \psi( b ) = (a  + \langle p(x) \rangle)  (b + \langle p(x)
\rangle) = a  b  + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi( a  b ). 
</me>
To prove that <m>\psi</m> is one-to-one, assume that
<me>
a + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi(a) = \psi(b) = b + \langle p(x)
\rangle. 
</me>
Then <m>a - b</m> is a multiple of <m>p(x)</m>, since it lives in the
ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m>. Since <m>p(x)</m> is a nonconstant
polynomial, the only possibility is that \mbox{<m>a - b = 0</m>}.
Consequently, <m>a = b</m> and <m>\psi</m> is injective. Since <m>\psi</m> is
one-to-one, we can identify <m>F</m> with the subfield $\{ a + \langle p(x)
\rangle : a \in F \}<m> of </m>E<m> and view </m>E<m> as an extension field of </m>F$.
 

It remains for us to prove that <m>p(x)</m> has a zero <m>\alpha \in E</m>. Set
<m>\alpha = x + \langle p(x) \rangle</m>. Then <m>\alpha</m> is in <m>E</m>. If $p(x) =
a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n$, then <!-- \alpha is in E not F - TWJ 4/23/2011 -->
<md><mrow>
p( \alpha )
&amp; = 
a_0 + a_1( x + \langle p(x) \rangle) + \cdots + a_n ( x + \langle p(x)
\rangle)^n</mrow><mrow>
&amp; = 
a_0 + ( a_1 x + \langle p(x) \rangle) + \cdots + (a_n  x^n + \langle p(x)
\rangle)</mrow><mrow>
&amp; = 
a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n + \langle p(x) \rangle</mrow><mrow>
&amp; = 
0 + \langle p(x) \rangle.
</mrow></md>
Therefore, we have found an element $\alpha \in E = F[x]/\langle p(x)
\rangle<m> such that </m>\alpha<m> is a zero of </m>p(x)$.
</p></proof>
 


<example xml:id="finite_field8">
<p>
Let <m>p(x) = x^5 + x^4 + 1 \in {\mathbb Z}_2[x]</m>. Then <m>p(x)</m> has irreducible
factors <m>x^2 + x + 1</m> and <m>x^3 + x + 1</m>. For a field extension <m>E</m> of
<m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m> such that <m>p(x)</m> has a root in <m>E</m>, we can let <m>E</m>
be either <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle</m> or ${\mathbb Z}_2[x] /
\langle x^3 + x + 1 \rangle$.  We will leave it as an exercise to
show that <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^3 + x + 1 \rangle</m> is a field
with <m>2^3=8</m> elements.

<example xml:id="extension_pi">
<p>
Both <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and <m>i</m> are algebraic over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> since they are
zeros of the polynomials <m>x^2 -2</m> and <m>x^2 + 1</m>, respectively. Clearly
<m>\pi</m> and <m>e</m> are algebraic over the real numbers; however, it is a
nontrivial fact that they are transcendental over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>. Numbers
in <m>{\mathbb R}</m> that are algebraic over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> are in fact quite
rare. Almost all real numbers are transcendental over ${\mathbb
Q}<m>.<footnote>FIXME: Move content in here</footnote>{If we choose a number in </m>{\mathbb R}$, then there is a
probability of 1 that the number will be transcendental over ${\mathbb
Q}$.}  
(In many cases we do not know whether or not a particular number is 
transcendental; for example, it is not known whether <m>\pi + e</m> is
transcendental or algebraic.)  

</p>
</example>
 
 
A complex number that is algebraic over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> is an <term> algebraic number</term><index><main>Algebraic number</main></index>. A \boldemph{transcendental

<example xml:id="field_sqrt3">
<p>
We will show that <m>\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3} }</m> is algebraic over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>.
If <m>\alpha = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3} }</m>, then <m>\alpha^2 = 2 + \sqrt{3}</m>.
Hence, <m>\alpha^2 -  2 = \sqrt{3}</m> and <m>( \alpha^2 -  2)^2 = 3</m>. Since
<m>\alpha^4 - 4 \alpha^2 + 1 = 0</m>, it must be true that <m>\alpha</m> is a
zero of the polynomial <m>x^4 - 4 x^2 + 1 \in {\mathbb Q}[x]</m>. 
</p>
</example>
 

It is very easy to give an example of an extension field <m>E</m> over a 
field <m>F</m>, where <m>E</m> contains an element transcendental over <m>F</m>. 
The following theorem characterizes transcendental extensions. 
 

<theorem>
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>E</m> be an extension field of <m>F</m> and <m>\alpha \in E</m>. Then <m>\alpha</m> 
is transcendental over <m>F</m> if and only if <m>F( \alpha )</m> is isomorphic
to <m>F(x)</m>, the field of fractions of <m>F[x]</m>.
</p>
FIXME-MOVE-IN-PROOF</statement>
</theorem>
 
 
<proof><p>
Let <m>\phi_{\alpha} : F[x] \rightarrow E</m> be the evaluation
homomorphism for <m>\alpha</m>. Then <m>\alpha</m> is transcendental over 
<m>F</m> if and only if <m>\phi_{\alpha} (p(x)) = p(\alpha) \neq 0</m> for all 
nonconstant polynomials <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m>.  This is true if and only 
if <m>\ker \phi_{\alpha} = \{ 0 \}</m>; that is, it is true exactly when 
<m>\phi_{\alpha}</m> is one-to-one. Hence, <m>E</m> must contain a copy of
<m>F[x]</m>.  The smallest field containing <m>F[x]</m> is the field of
fractions <m>F(x)</m>.  By Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="domains:field_of_quotients_ther" />, <m>E</m> must contain a copy of this
field.
</p></proof>




 
We have a more interesting situation in the case of algebraic
extensions.


<theorem>

<p>
Let <m>E</m> be an extension field of a field <m>F</m> and <m>\alpha \in E</m> with
<m>\alpha</m> algebraic over <m>F</m>. Then there is a unique irreducible monic
polynomial <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m> of smallest degree such that $p( \alpha ) =
0<m>. If </m>f(x)<m> is another polynomial in </m>F[x]$ such that 
<m>f(\alpha) = 0</m>, then <m>p(x)</m> divides <m>f(x)</m>.   
</p>
FIXME-MOVE-IN-PROOF</statement>
</theorem>

<!--  Removed the hypothesis that f(x) be monic.  Suggested by Davis Schubert. - TWJ 4/24/2013 -->
 
 
<proof><p>
Let <m>\phi_{\alpha} : F[x] \rightarrow E</m> be the evaluation
homomorphism. The kernel of <m>\phi_{\alpha}</m> is a principal ideal
generated by some <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m> with <m>\deg p(x) \geq 1</m>. We know
that such a polynomial exists, since <m>F[x]</m> is a principal ideal domain
and <m>\alpha</m> is algebraic. The ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> consists
exactly of those elements of <m>F[x]</m> having <m>\alpha</m> as a zero. If $f(
\alpha ) = 0<m> and </m>f(x)<m> is not the zero polynomial, then </m>f(x) \in
\langle p(x) \rangle<m> and </m>p(x)<m> divides </m>f(x)<m>. So </m>p(x)$ is a
polynomial of minimal degree having <m>\alpha</m> as a zero. Any other
polynomial of the same degree having <m>\alpha</m> as a zero must have the
form <m>\beta p( x)</m> for some <m>\beta \in F</m>. 
 

Suppose now that <m>p(x) = r(x) s(x)</m> is a factorization of <m>p</m> into
polynomials of lower degree. Since <m>p( \alpha ) = 0</m>, $r( \alpha ) s(
\alpha ) = 0<m>; consequently, either \mbox{</m>r( \alpha )=0$} or
\mbox{<m>s( \alpha ) = 0</m>}, which contradicts the fact that <m>p</m> is of
minimal degree. Therefore, <m>p(x)</m> must be irreducible.
</p></proof>
 


 
 
Let <m>E</m> be an extension field of <m>F</m> and <m>\alpha \in E</m> be algebraic
over <m>F</m>. The unique monic polynomial <m>p(x)</m> of the last theorem is

<m>g(x)</m> must be the zero polynomial. Consequently, 
<me>
b_0 - c_0 = b_1 - c_1 = \cdots = b_{n-1} - c_{n-1} = 0,

Since <m>x^2 + 1</m> is irreducible over <m>{\mathbb R}</m>, $\langle x^2 + 1

Let <m>E</m> be a field extension of a field <m>F</m>.  If we regard <m>E</m> as a
vector space over <m>F</m>, then we can bring the machinery of linear
algebra to bear on the problems that we will encounter in our study of
fields. The elements in the field <m>E</m> are vectors; the elements
in the field <m>F</m> are scalars. We can think of addition in <m>E</m> as
adding vectors.  When we multiply an element in <m>E</m> by an element of
<m>F</m>, we are multiplying a vector by a scalar.  This view of field 
extensions is especially fruitful if a field extension <m>E</m> of <m>F</m> 
is a finite dimensional vector space over <m>F</m>, and Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="fields:simple_ext_theorem" /> states
that <m>E = F(\alpha )</m> is finite dimensional vector space over <m>F</m> with

If an extension field <m>E</m> of a field <m>F</m> is a finite dimensional

Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="fields:finite_ext_theorem" /> says that every finite extension of a field <m>F</m> is an

The next theorem is a counting theorem, similar to Lagrange's Theorem
in group theory. Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="fields:finite_ext_theorem" /> will prove to be an extremely useful
tool in our investigation of finite field extensions. 
 

<theorem xml:id="fields:tower_indices_theorem">
<statement>
<p>
If <m>E</m> is a finite extension of <m>F</m> and <m>K</m> is a finite extension of

\[ 
[K:F]= [K:E] [E:F].
</me>
</p>
FIXME-MOVE-IN-PROOF</statement>
</theorem>
 

<proof><p>
Let <m>\{ \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \}</m> be a basis for <m>E</m> as a vector
space over <m>F</m> and <m>\{ \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_m \}</m> be a basis for
<m>K</m> as a vector space over <m>E</m>. We claim that $\{ \alpha_i \beta_j
\}<m> is a basis for </m>K<m> over </m>F$.  
We will first show that these vectors span <m>K</m>. Let <m>u \in K</m>. Then $u
= \sum_{j=1}^{m} b_j \beta_j<m> and </m>b_j = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{ij}
\alpha_i<m>, where </m>b_j \in E<m> and </m>a_{ij} \in F$.	Then 
<me>
u = \sum_{j=1}^{m} \left(  \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{ij}
\alpha_i  \right) \beta_j = \sum_{i,j} a_{ij} ( \alpha_i
\beta_j ).
</me>
So the <m>mn</m> vectors <m>\alpha_i \beta_j</m> must span <m>K</m> over <m>F</m>. 


We must show that <m>\{ \alpha_i \beta_j \}</m> are linearly independent.
Recall that a set of vectors <m>v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n</m> in a vector
space <m>V</m> are linearly independent if 
<me>
c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \cdots + c_n v_n = 0
</me>
implies that
<me>
c_1 = c_2 = \cdots = c_n = 0.
</me>
Let 
<me>
u = \sum_{i,j} c_{ij} ( \alpha_i \beta_j ) = 0
</me>
for <m>c_{ij} \in F</m>. We need to prove that all of the <m>c_{ij}</m>'s are
zero. We can rewrite <m>u</m> as
<me>
\sum_{j=1}^{m} \left(  \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{ij} \alpha_i
\right) \beta_j = 0,
</me>
where <m>\sum_i c_{ij} \alpha_i \in E</m>.  Since the <m>\beta_j</m>'s are
linearly independent over <m>E</m>, it must be the case that 
<me>
\sum_{i=1}^n c_{ij} \alpha_i = 0
</me>
for all <m>j</m>. However, the <m>\alpha_j</m> are also linearly independent 
over <m>F</m>.  Therefore, <m>c_{ij} = 0</m> for all <m>i</m> and <m>j</m>, which
completes the proof.

Let us determine an extension field of <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> containing $\sqrt{3}

<m>\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}</m> is <m>x^4 - 16 x^2 + 4</m>. It follows that

[ {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}\, ) : {\mathbb Q} ] = 4.

We know that <m>\{ 1, \sqrt{3}\, \}</m> is a basis for  ${\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}\,
)<m> over </m>{\mathbb Q}<m>. Hence, </m>\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}<m> cannot be in </m>{\mathbb

This example shows that it is possible
that some extension <m>F( \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n )</m> is actually a
simple extension of <m>F</m> even though <m>n \gt 1</m>.

real cube root of 5.  We know that $\sqrt{5} \, i \notin {\mathbb

<me>
[ {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt[3]{5}, \sqrt{5}\, i) : {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt[3]{5}\, )] = 2.

We also know
that <m>\{ 1, \sqrt[3]{5}, (\sqrt[3]{5}\, )^2  \}</m> is a basis for ${\mathbb

(\sqrt[6]{5}\, )^7 i = 5 \sqrt[6]{5}\, i \text{ or } \sqrt[6]{5}\, i \}. 
</me>
Notice that <m>\sqrt[6]{5}\, i</m> is a zero of <m>x^6 + 5</m>. We can show that
this polynomial is irreducible over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> using Eisenstein's

Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>p(x)</m> be a nonconstant polynomial in <m>F[x]</m>.
We already know that we can find a field extension of <m>F</m> that
contains a root of <m>p(x)</m>. However, we would like to know whether an
extension <m>E</m> of <m>F</m> containing all of the roots of <m>p(x)</m> exists.
In other words, can we find a field extension of <m>F</m> such that <m>p(x)</m>
factors into a product of linear polynomials? What is the <q>smallest</q>

Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n</m> be a

</me>
A polynomial <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m> <term>splits</term> in <m>E</m> if it is the

We will use mathematical induction on the degree of <m>p(x)</m>.  If $\deg

<m>K</m>. Hence, <m>p(x) = (x - \alpha_1)q(x)</m>, where <m>q(x) \in K[x]</m>. Since
<m>\deg q(x) = n -1</m>, there exists a splitting field <m>E \supset K</m> of
<m>q(x)</m> that contains the zeros <m>\alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n</m> of <m>p(x)</m>
by our induction hypothesis. Consequently,   
<me>
E = K(\alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n) = F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n)
</me>
is a splitting field of <m>p(x)</m>.
</p></proof>




The question of uniqueness now arises for splitting fields. This
question is answered in the affirmative. Given two splitting fields
<m>K</m> and <m>L</m> of a polynomial <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m>, there exists a field
isomorphism <m>\phi : K \rightarrow L</m> that preserves <m>F</m>. In order to
prove this result, we must first prove a lemma. 



<lemma xml:id="fields:isomorph_lemma">
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>\phi : E \rightarrow F</m> be an isomorphism of fields. Let <m>K</m> be
an extension field of <m>E</m> and <m>\alpha \in K</m> be algebraic over <m>E</m>
with minimal polynomial <m>p(x)</m>. Suppose that <m>L</m> is an extension field
of <m>F</m> such that <m>\beta</m> is root of the polynomial in <m>F[x]</m> obtained
from <m>p(x)</m> under the image of <m>\phi</m>.  Then <m>\phi</m> extends to a unique
isomorphism <m>\psi : E( \alpha ) \rightarrow F( \beta )</m> such that
<m>\psi( \alpha ) = \beta</m> and <m>\psi</m> agrees with <m>\phi</m> on <m>E</m>.  
</p>
FIXME-MOVE-IN-PROOF</statement>
</lemma>




<proof><p>
If <m>p(x)</m> has degree <m>n</m>, then by Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="fields:simple_ext_theorem" /> we can write any
element in <m>E( \alpha )</m> as a linear combination of $1, \alpha,
\ldots, \alpha^{n-1}$. Therefore, the isomorphism that we are seeking
must be   
<me>
\psi( a_0 + a_1 \alpha + \cdots + a_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1})
= \phi(a_0) + \phi(a_1) \beta + \cdots + \phi(a_{n-1}) \beta^{n-1}, 
</me>
where 
<me>
a_0 + a_1 \alpha + \cdots + a_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1}
</me>
is an
element in <m>E(\alpha)</m>. The fact that <m>\psi</m> is an isomorphism could
be checked by direct computation; however, it is easier to observe
that <m>\psi</m> is a composition of maps that we already know to be 
isomorphisms.   

We can extend <m>\phi</m> to be an isomorphism from <m>E[x]</m> to <m>F[x]</m>, which
we will also denote by <m>\phi</m>, by letting
<me>
\phi( a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n )
= 
\phi( a_0 ) + \phi(a_1) x + \cdots + \phi(a_n) x^n.
</me>
This extension agrees with the original isomorphism
<m>\phi~:~E~\rightarrow~F</m>, since constant polynomials get mapped to
constant polynomials.  By assumption, <m>\phi(p(x)) = q(x)</m>; hence,
<m>\phi</m> maps <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> onto <m>\langle q(x) \rangle</m>.
Consequently, we have an isomorphism
\mbox{$\overline{\phi} : E[x] / \langle~p(x) \rangle \rightarrow
F[x]/\langle~q(x) \rangle$}. By Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="fields:min_poly_prop" />, we have 
isomorphisms
\mbox{<m>\sigma: E[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle \rightarrow F(\alpha)</m>} and
\mbox{<m>\tau : F[x]/\langle q(x) \rangle \rightarrow F( \beta )</m>},
defined by evaluation at <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>, respectively.
Therefore, <m>\psi = \tau^{-1} \overline{\phi} \sigma</m> is the required
isomorphism.

<title>Geometric Constructions</title>


In ancient Greece, three classic problems were posed. These problems
are geometric in nature and involve straightedge-and-compass
constructions from what is now high school geometry; that is, we are
allowed to use only a straightedge and compass to solve them. The
problems can be stated as follows.    
\begin{enumerate}

</li><li>
Given an arbitrary angle, can one trisect the angle into three equal
subangles using only a straightedge and compass?

</li><li>
Given an arbitrary circle, can one construct a square with the same
area using only a straightedge and compass?

</li><li>
Given a cube, can one construct the edge of another cube having twice
the volume of the original? Again, we are only allowed to use a
straightedge and compass to do the construction.

\end{enumerate}
After puzzling mathematicians for over two thousand years, each of
these constructions was finally shown to be impossible.  We will use
the theory of fields to provide a proof that the solutions do not
exist.  It is quite remarkable that the long-sought solution to each
of these three geometric problems came from abstract algebra.  


First, let us determine more specifically what we mean by a
straightedge and compass, and also examine the nature of these
problems in a bit more depth.  To begin with, \emph{a straightedge is
not a ruler}. We cannot measure arbitrary lengths with a straightedge.
It is merely a tool for drawing a line through two points. The
statement that the trisection of an arbitrary angle is impossible
means that there is at least one angle that is impossible to trisect
with a straightedge-and-compass construction. Certainly it is
possible to trisect an angle in special cases.  We can construct a
<m>30^\circ</m> angle; hence, it is possible to trisect a <m>90^\circ</m>
angle.  However, we will show that it is impossible to construct a 
<m>20^\circ</m> angle.  Therefore, we cannot trisect a <m>60^\circ</m> angle.

that both <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> are positive with <m>\alpha \gt \beta</m>. It
is quite obvious how to construct <m>\alpha + \beta</m> and $\alpha -
\beta<m>. To find a line segment with length </m>\alpha \beta$, we assume
that <m>\beta \gt 1</m> and construct the triangle in Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="Multiply" />
such that triangles <m>\triangle ABC</m> and <m>\triangle ADE</m> are similar.
Since <m>\alpha / 1 = x / \beta</m>, the line segment <m>x</m> has length
<m>\alpha \beta</m>.  A similar construction can be made if <m>\beta \lt 1</m>. We
will leave it as an exercise to show that the same triangle can be

\end{enumerate}
</p>
FIXME-MOVE-IN-PROOF</statement>
</lemma>


<proof><p>
Let <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2, y_2)</m> be points on a line whose
coordinates are in <m>F</m>.  If <m>x_1 = x_2</m>, then the equation of the line

(x - x_1)^2 + (y - y_1)^2 - r^2 = 0.
</me>
This equation can easily be put into the appropriate form.
</p></proof>





Starting with a field of constructible numbers <m>F</m>, we have three 
possible ways of constructing additional points in <m>{\mathbb R}</m> with a
compass and straightedge. 
\begin{enumerate}
 
</li><li> 
To find possible new points in <m>{\mathbb R}</m>, we can take the
intersection of two lines, each of which passes through two known
points with coordinates in <m>F</m>. 
 
</li><li> 
The intersection of a line that passes through two points that have 
coordinates in <m>F</m> and a circle whose center has coordinates in <m>F</m> 
with radius of a length in <m>F</m> will give new points in <m>{\mathbb R}</m>.
 
</li><li> 
We can obtain new points in <m>{\mathbb R}</m> by intersecting two
circles whose centers have coordinates in <m>F</m> and whose radii are of
lengths in <m>F</m>.
 
\end{enumerate}
The first case gives no new points in <m>{\mathbb R}</m>, since the solution 
of two equations of the form <m>a x + by + c = 0</m> having coefficients in
<m>F</m> will always be in <m>F</m>. The third case can be reduced to the second
case.  Let
<md><mrow>
x^2 + y^2 + d_1 x +e_1 y + f_1 = 0</mrow><mrow>
x^2 + y^2 + d_2 x +e_2 y + f_2 = 0
</mrow></md> <!-- corrected equation - 28 April 2012 - TWJ -->
be the equations of two circles, where <m>d_i</m>, <m>e_i</m>, and <m>f_i</m> are in
<m>F</m> for <m>i = 1, 2</m>. These circles have the same intersection as the
circle  
<me>
x^2 + y^2 + d_1 x +e_1 x + f_1 = 0 
</me>
and the line
<me>
(d_1 - d_2) x + b(e_2 - e_1)y + (f_2 - f_1) = 0.
</me>
The last equation is that of the chord passing through the
intersection points of the two circles. Hence, the intersection of two
circles can be reduced to the case of an intersection of a line with a
circle. 
 

Considering the case of the intersection of a line and a circle, we
must determine the nature of the solutions of the equations
<md><mrow>
a x + by + c &amp; = 0</mrow><mrow>
x^2 + y^2 + d x + e y + f &amp; = 0.
</mrow></md>
If we eliminate <m>y</m> from these equations, we obtain an equation of
the form <m>Ax^2 + B x + C = 0</m>, where <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> are in <m>F</m>. The
<m>x</m> coordinate of the intersection points is given by

</me>
and is in <m>F( \sqrt{\alpha}\, )</m>, where <m>\alpha = B^2 - 4 A C \gt 0</m>.

We are now ready to investigate the classical problems of doubling

constructible numbers to show exactly when a particular geometric
construction can be accomplished.    

 
<em>Doubling the cube is impossible<index><main>Doubling the cube</em></main></index>.  Given the
edge of the cube, it is impossible to construct with a straightedge
and compass the edge of the cube that has twice the volume of the
original cube. Let the original cube have an edge of length 1 and,
therefore, a volume of  1. If we could construct a cube having a
volume of 2, then this new cube would have an edge of length
<m>\sqrt[3]{2}</m>. However, <m>\sqrt[3]{2}</m> is a zero of the irreducible
polynomial <m>x^3 -2</m> over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>; hence, 
<me>
[{\mathbb Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}\, ) : {\mathbb Q}] =3
</me>
This is impossible, since 3 is not a power of 2.
 
 
<em>Squaring the circle<index><main>Squaring the circle</em> is impossible</main></index>.
Suppose that we have a circle of radius 1.  The area of the circle 
is <m>\pi</m>; therefore, we must be able to construct a square with side
<m>\sqrt{\pi}</m>. This is impossible since <m>\pi</m> and consequently
<m>\sqrt{\pi}</m> are both transcendental. Therefore, using a straightedge

\theta =  \cos 60^\circ = 1/2$. By the triple-angle formula for the
cosine,
<me>
4 \alpha^3 - 3 \alpha = \frac{1}{2}.
</me>
Therefore, <m>\alpha</m> is a zero of <m>8 x^3 - 6 x -1</m>.  This polynomial
has no factors in <m>{\mathbb Z}[x]</m>, and hence is irreducible over ${\mathbb
Q}[x]<m>. Thus, </m>[{\mathbb Q}( \alpha ) : {\mathbb Q }] = 3$. Consequently,
<m>\alpha</m> cannot be a constructible number.

Algebraic number theory uses the tools of algebra to solve problems in
number theory.  Modern algebraic number theory began with
Pierre de Fermat<index><main>Fermat, Pierre de</main></index> (1601<ndash />1665). Certainly we
can find many positive integers that satisfy the equation $x^2 + y^2 =
z^2<m>; Fermat conjectured that the equation </m>x^n + y^n = z^n$ has no
positive integer solutions for <m>n \geq 3</m>.  He stated in the margin of
his copy of the Latin translation of Diophantus' <title>Arithmetica</title>
that he had found a marvelous proof of this theorem, but that the
margin of the book was too narrow to contain it.    Building on work of other mathematicians, it was Andrew Wiles who finally succeeded in proving Fermat's Last Theorem in the 1990s. Wiles's achievement was reported on the front page of the <title>New York Times</title>.


Attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem have led to important
contributions to algebraic number theory by such notable
mathematicians as Leonhard Euler<index><main>Euler, Leonhard</main></index> (1707<ndash />1783).
Significant advances in the understanding of Fermat's Last
Theorem were made by Ernst Kummer<index><main>Kummer, Ernst</main></index> (1810<ndash />1893). 
Kummer's student, Leopold \mbox{Kronecker}<index><main>Kronecker, Leopold</main></index>
(1823<ndash />1891), became one of the leading algebraists of the nineteenth
century. \mbox{Kronecker's} theory of  ideals and his study of algebraic
number theory added much to the understanding of fields. 


David Hilbert<index><main>Hilbert, David</main></index> (1862<ndash />1943) and Hermann
Minkowski<index><main>Minkowski, Hermann</main></index> (1864<ndash />1909) were
among the mathematicians who led the way in this subject at the  
beginning of the twentieth century.  Hilbert and Minkowski were both
mathematicians at G\"{o}ttingen University in Germany. G\"{o}ttingen
was truly one the most important centers of mathematical research
during the last two centuries. The large number of exceptional
mathematicians who studied there included Gauss, Dirichlet, Riemann,
Dedekind, Noether, and~Weyl.


Andr\'{e} Weil<index><main>Weil, Andr\'{e</main></index>} answered questions in number theory
using algebraic geometry, a field of mathematics that studies geometry
by studying commutative rings. From about 1955 to 1970, A.
Grothendieck<index><main>Grothendieck, A.</main></index> dominated the field of algebraic
geometry. Pierre Deligne<index><main>Deligne, Pierre</main></index>, a student of
Grothendieck, solved several of Weil's number-theoretic conjectures.
One of the most recent contributions to algebra and number theory is
Gerd Falting's<index><main>Faltings, Gerd</main></index> proof of the Mordell-Weil
conjecture<index><main>Mordell-Weil conjecture</main></index>. This conjecture of
Mordell and Weil essentially says that certain polynomials <m>p(x, y )</m> in
<m>{\mathbb Z}[x,y]</m> have only a finite number of integral solutions.
