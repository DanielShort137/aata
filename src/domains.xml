<title>Integral Domains</title>

<introduction>

</introduction>
 
One of the most important rings we study is the ring of integers.  It was our first example of an algebraic structure: the first polynomial
ring that we examined was <m>{\mathbb Z}[x]</m>.  We also know that the integers sit naturally inside the field of rational numbers, ${\mathbb
Q}$.  The ring of integers is the model for all integral domains.  In this chapter we will examine integral domains in general, answering
questions about the ideal structure of integral domains, polynomial rings over integral domains, and whether or not an integral domain can
be embedded in a field.

<section xml:id="">
<title>Fields of Fractions</title>

Every field is also an integral domain; however, there are many integral domains that are not fields.  For example, the integers <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> are an integral domain but not a field.  A question that naturally arises is how we might associate an integral domain with a field.  There is a natural way to construct the rationals <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> from the integers: the rationals can be represented as formal quotients of two integers.  The rational numbers are certainly a field.  In fact, it can be shown that the rationals are the smallest field that contains the integers.  Given an integral domain <m>D</m>, our question now becomes how to construct a smallest field <m>F</m> containing <m>D</m>.  We will do this in the same way as we constructed the rationals from the integers.  

An element <m>p/q \in {\mathbb Q}</m> is the quotient of two integers <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>; however, different pairs of integers can represent the same
rational number.  For instance, <m>1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6</m>. We know that 
<me>
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}
</me>
if and only if <m>ad = bc</m>. A more formal way of considering this problem is to examine fractions in terms of equivalence relations.  We can think of elements in <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> as ordered pairs in <m>{\mathbb Z} \times {\mathbb Z}</m>.  A quotient <m>p/q</m> can be written as <m>(p, q)</m>.  For instance, <m>(3, 7)</m> would represent the fraction <m>3/7</m>.  However, there are problems if we consider all possible pairs in <m>{\mathbb Z} \times {\mathbb Z}</m>.  There is no fraction <m>5/0</m> corresponding to the pair <m>(5,0)</m>.  Also, the pairs <m>(3,6)</m> and <m>(2,4)</m> both represent the fraction <m>1/2</m>.  The first problem is easily solved if we require the second coordinate to be nonzero.  The second problem is solved by considering two pairs <m>(a, b)</m> and <m>(c, d)</m> to be equivalent if <m>ad = bc</m>.

If we use the approach of ordered pairs instead of fractions, then we can study integral domains in general.  Let <m>D</m> be any integral domain and let 
<me>
S = \{ (a, b) : a, b \in D \mbox{ and } b \neq 0 \}.
</me>
Define a relation on <m>S</m> by <m>(a, b) \sim (c, d)</m> if <m>ad=bc</m>.

<lemma>
<statement>
<p>
The relation <m>\sim</m> between elements of <m>S</m> is an equivalence relation. 
</p>
FIXME-MOVE-IN-PROOF</statement>
</lemma>
 
<proof><p>
Since <m>D</m> is commutative, <m>ab = ba</m>; hence, <m>\sim</m> is reflexive on <m>D</m>.
Now suppose that <m>(a,b) \sim (c,d)</m>. Then <m>ad=bc</m> or <m>cb = da</m>.
Therefore, <m>(c,d) \sim (a, b)</m> and the relation is symmetric. Finally,
to show that the relation is transitive, let <m>(a, b) \sim (c, d)</m> and
<m>(c, d) \sim (e,f)</m>. In this case <m>ad=bc</m> and <m>cf = de</m>. Multiplying
both sides of <m>ad=bc</m> by <m>f</m> yields
<me>
a f d = a d f = b c f = b d e = bed.
</me>
Since <m>D</m> is an integral domain, we can deduce that <m>af = be</m> or 
<m>(a,b ) \sim (e, f)</m>. 
</p></proof>
 


 

We will denote the set of equivalence classes on <m>S</m> by <m>F_D</m>. We now
need to define the operations of addition and multiplication on
<m>F_D</m>.  Recall how fractions are added and multiplied in ${\mathbb
Q}$:
<md><mrow>
\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} &amp; = \frac{ad + b c}{b d};</mrow><mrow>
\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} &amp; = \frac{ac}{b d}.
</mrow></md>
It seems reasonable to define the operations of addition and
multiplication on <m>F_D</m> in a similar manner.  If we denote the
equivalence class of <m>(a, b) \in S</m> by <m>[a, b]</m>, then we are led to
define the operations of addition and multiplication on <m>F_D</m> by
<me>
[a, b] + [c, d] = [ad + b c,b d]
</me>
and
<me>
[a, b] \cdot [c, d] = [ac, b d],
</me>
respectively.  The next lemma demonstrates that these operations are
independent of the choice of representatives from each equivalence
class.
 
 
<lemma>
<statement>
<p>
The operations of addition and multiplication on <m>F_D</m> are well-defined.
</p>
FIXME-MOVE-IN-PROOF</statement>
</lemma>
 

<proof><p>
We will prove that the operation of addition is well-defined.  The
proof that multiplication is well-defined is left as an exercise.
Let <m>[a_1, b_1] = [a_2, b_2]</m> and <m>[c_1, d_1] =[ c_2, d_2]</m>.  We must
show that
<me>
[a_1 d_1 + b_1 c_1,b_1 d_1] = [a_2 d_2 + b_2 c_2,b_2 d_2]
</me>
or, equivalently, that
<me>
(a_1 d_1 + b_1 c_1)( b_2 d_2) = (b_1 d_1) (a_2 d_2 + b_2 c_2).
</me>
Since  <m>[a_1, b_1] = [a_2, b_2]</m> and <m>[c_1, d_1] =[ c_2, d_2]</m>, we
know that <m>a_1 b_2 = b_1 a_2</m> and <m>c_1 d_2 = d_1 c_2</m>.  Therefore,
<md><mrow>
(a_1 d_1 + b_1 c_1)( b_2 d_2) 
&amp; = 
a_1 d_1 b_2 d_2 + b_1 c_1 b_2 d_2</mrow><mrow>
&amp; =
a_1 b_2 d_1 d_2 + b_1 b_2 c_1 d_2</mrow><mrow>
&amp; =
b_1 a_2 d_1 d_2 + b_1 b_2 d_1 c_2</mrow><mrow>
&amp; = 
(b_1 d_1) (a_2 d_2 + b_2 c_2).
</mrow></md>
</p></proof>

</p>
FIXME-MOVE-IN-PROOF</statement>
</lemma>
 

<proof><p>
The additive and multiplicative identities are <m>[0,1]</m> and <m>[1,1]</m>, 
respectively. To show that <m>[0,1]</m> is the additive identity, observe 
that
<me>
[a, b] + [0, 1] =  [ a 1 + b 0, b 1] = [a,b].
</me>
It is easy to show that <m>[1, 1]</m> is the multiplicative identity. Let
<m>[a, b] \in F_D</m> such that <m>a \neq 0</m>. Then <m>[b, a]</m> is also in <m>F_D</m>
and <m>[a,b] \cdot [b, a] = [1,1]</m>; hence, <m>[b, a]</m> is the
multiplicative inverse for <m>[a, b]</m>.  Similarly, <m>[-a,b]</m> is the
additive inverse of <m>[a, b]</m>.  We leave as exercises the verification
of the associative and  commutative properties of multiplication in
<m>F_D</m>. We also leave it to the reader to show that <m>F_D</m> is an abelian
group under addition.  
 
 
It remains to show that the distributive property holds in <m>F_D</m>;
however, 
<md><mrow>
[a, b] [e, f] + [c, d][ e, f ] 
&amp; = 
[a e, b f ] + [c e, d f]</mrow><mrow>
&amp; =
[a e d f + b f c e, b d f^2 ]</mrow><mrow>
&amp; =
[a e d + b c e, b d f ]</mrow><mrow>
&amp; =
[a d e + b c e, b d f ]</mrow><mrow>
&amp; =
( [a, b]  + [c, d] ) [ e, f ] 
</mrow></md>
and the lemma is proved.

The field <m>F_D</m> in Lemma<nbsp /><xref ref="domains:field_fractions_lemma" /> is called the <term>field of fractions</term><index><main>Field</main><sub>of fractions</sub></index> or \boldemph{field of

<theorem xml:id="domains:field_of_quotients_ther">
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>D</m> be an integral domain.  Then <m>D</m> can be embedded in a field of
fractions <m>F_D</m>, where any element in <m>F_D</m> can be expressed as the
quotient of two elements in <m>D</m>.  Furthermore, the field of fractions
<m>F_D</m> is unique in the sense that if <m>E</m> is any field containing <m>D</m>,
then there exists a map <m>\psi : F_D \rightarrow E</m> giving an isomorphism
with a subfield of <m>E</m> such that <m>\psi(a) = a</m> for all elements $a \in
D$. 
</p>
FIXME-MOVE-IN-PROOF</statement>
</theorem>
 

<proof><p>
We will first demonstrate that <m>D</m> can be embedded in the field 
<m>F_D</m>.  Define a map <m>\phi : D \rightarrow F_D</m> by $\phi(a) 
= [a, 1]<m>.  Then for </m>a<m> and </m>b<m> in </m>D$,
<me>
\phi( a + b ) = [a+b, 1] = [a, 1] + [b, 1] = \phi(a ) + \phi(b)
</me>
and
<me>
\phi( a b ) = [a b, 1] = [a, 1]  [b, 1] = \phi(a ) \phi(b);
</me>
hence, <m>\phi</m> is a homomorphism.  To show that <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one,
suppose that <m>\phi(a) = \phi( b)</m>.  Then <m>[a, 1] = [b, 1]</m>, or $a = a1
= 1b = b<m>. Finally, any element of </m>F_D$ can be expressed as the quotient
of two elements in <m>D</m>, since   
<me>
\phi(a) [\phi(b)]^{-1} = [a, 1] [b, 1]^{-1} = [a, 1] \cdot [1, b]
= [a, b].

Now let <m>E</m> be a field containing <m>D</m> and define a map $\psi :F_D
\rightarrow E<m> by </m>\psi([a, b]) = a b^{-1}<m>.  To show that </m>\psi$ is
well-defined, let <m>[a_1, b_1] = [a_2, b_2]</m>. Then <m>a_1 b_2 = b_1 a_2</m>.
Therefore, <m>a_1 b_1^{-1} = a_2 b_2^{-1}</m>  and $\psi( [a_1, b_1]) =
\psi( [a_2, b_2])$.
 

If <m>[a, b ]</m> and <m>[c, d]</m> are in <m>F_D</m>, then
<md><mrow>
\psi( [a, b] + [c, d] ) 
&amp; = \psi( [ad + b c, b d ] )</mrow><mrow>
&amp; =  (ad +b c)(b d)^{-1}</mrow><mrow>
&amp; = a b^{-1} + c d^{-1}</mrow><mrow>
&amp; = \psi( [a, b] ) + \psi( [c, d] )
</mrow></md>
and
<md><mrow>
\psi( [a, b] \cdot [c, d] ) &amp; = \psi( [ac, b d ] )\\
 &amp; =  (ac)(b d)^{-1}\\
&amp; = a b^{-1}  c d^{-1}\\
 &amp; = \psi( [a, b] )  \psi( [c, d] ).
</mrow></md>
Therefore, <m>\psi</m> is a homomorphism.
 

To complete the proof of the theorem, we need to show that <m>\psi</m> is
one-to-one.  Suppose that <m>\psi( [a, b] ) = ab^{-1} = 0</m>. Then $a =
0b = 0<m> and </m>[a, b] = [0, b]<m>.  Therefore, the kernel of </m>\psi$ is
the zero element <m>[ 0, b]</m> in <m>F_D</m>, and <m>\psi</m> is injective.

Since <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> is a field, <m>{\mathbb Q}[x]</m> is an integral domain. The

<title>Factorization in Integral Domains</title>

 
The building blocks of the integers are the prime numbers.  If <m>F</m> is
a field, then irreducible polynomials in <m>F[x]</m> play a role that is
very similar to that of the prime numbers in the ring of integers.
Given an arbitrary integral domain, we are led to the following
series of definitions. 
 

Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with identity, and let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be
elements in <m>R</m>.  We say that <m>a</m> <term>divides</term> <m>b</m>, and write $a \mid
b<m>, if there exists an element </m>c \in R<m> such that </m>b = ac<m>.  A <term> unit</term><index><main>Unit</main></index> in </m>R$ is an element that has a multiplicative
inverse.  Two elements <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in <m>R</m> are said to be <term> associates</term><index><main>Element</main><sub>associate</sub></index><index><main>Associate elements</main></index> if
there exists a unit <m>u</m> in <m>R</m> such that <m>a = ub</m>.   
 

Let <m>D</m> be an integral domain.  A nonzero element <m>p \in D</m> that is
not a unit is said to be <term> irreducible</term><index><main>Element</main><sub>irreducible</sub></index><index><main>Irreducible element</main></index>
provided that whenever <m>p = ab</m>, either <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> is a unit.
Furthermore, <m>p</m> is <term> prime</term><index><main>Prime element</main></index><index><main>Element</main><sub>prime</sub></index> if whenever $p \mid
ab<m> either </m>p \mid a<m> or </m>p \mid b$.


<example xml:id="Qxy">
<p>
It is important to notice that prime and irreducible elements do not
always coincide. Let <m>R</m> be the subring (with identity) of <m>{\mathbb Q}[x, y]</m> generated
by <m>x^2</m>, <m>y^2</m>, and <m>xy</m>.  Each of these elements is irreducible in
<m>R</m>; however, <m>xy</m> is not prime, since <m>xy</m> divides <m>x^2 y^2</m> but does
not divide either <m>x^2</m> or <m>y^2</m>.
</p>
</example>

<!-- We are assuming that R is an integral domain and contains 1.  TWJ 8/9/2012 -->

 
 
The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every positive
integer <m>n \gt 1</m> can be factored into a product of prime numbers $p_1
\cdots p_k<m>, where the </m>p_i$'s are not necessarily distinct. We also
know that such factorizations are unique up to the order of the
<m>p_i</m>'s. We can easily extend this result to the integers. The
question arises of whether or not such factorizations are possible in
other rings.  Generalizing this definition, we say an integral domain
<m>D</m> is a <term>unique factorization domain</term>,\index{Unique
factorization domain (UFD)}<index><main>Domain</main><sub>unique factorization</sub></index> or <term> UFD</term>, if <m>D</m> satisfies the following criteria.  
\begin{enumerate}
 
</li><li>
Let <m>a \in D</m> such that <m>a \neq 0</m> and <m>a</m> is not a unit.
Then <m>a</m> can be written as the product of irreducible
elements in <m>D</m>.
 
</li><li> <!-- Definition corrected thanks to Pascal Honore - TWJ 9/10/2010 -->
Let <m>a = p_1 \cdots p_r = q_1 \cdots q_s</m>, where the <m>p_i</m>'s and the
<m>q_i</m>'s are irreducible. Then <m>r=s</m> and there is a <m>\pi \in S_r</m> such
that <m>p_i</m> and <m>q_{\pi(j)}</m> are associates for \mbox{<m>j = 1, \ldots, r</m>}. 
 
\end{enumerate}


<example xml:id="Z_UFD">
<p>
The integers are a unique factorization domain by the Fundamental
Theorem of Arithmetic.
</p>
</example>
 


<example xml:id="not_a_UFD">
<p>
Not every integral domain is a unique factorization domain. The
subring <m>{\mathbb Z}[ \sqrt{3}\, i ] = \{ a + b \sqrt{3}\, i\}</m> of the
complex numbers is an integral domain (Exercise<nbsp /><xref ref="rings:gaussian_exercise" />, Chapter<nbsp /><xref ref="rings" />). Let
<m>z = a + b \sqrt{3}\, i</m> and define \mbox{$\nu : {\mathbb Z}[ \sqrt{3}\, i ]
\rightarrow {\mathbb N} \cup \{ 0 \}<m>} by </m>\nu( z) = |z|^2 = a^2 + 3 b^2$.
It is clear that <m>\nu(z) \geq 0</m> with equality when <m>z = 0</m>. Also,
from our knowledge of complex numbers we know that $\nu(z w) = \nu(z)
\nu(w)<m>. It is easy to show that if </m>\nu(z) = 1<m>, then </m>z$ is a unit,
and that the only units of <m>{\mathbb Z}[ \sqrt{3}\, i ]</m> are 1 and <m>-1</m>.   
 

We claim that 4 has two distinct factorizations into irreducible
elements: 
<me>
4 = 2 \cdot 2 = (1 - \sqrt{3}\, i) (1 + \sqrt{3}\, i).
</me>
We must show that each of these factors is an irreducible element in
<m>{\mathbb Z}[ \sqrt{3}\, i ]</m>. If 2 is not irreducible, then <m>2 = z w</m> for
elements <m>z, w</m> in <m>{\mathbb Z}[ \sqrt{3}\, i ]</m> where $\nu( z) = \nu(w) =
2<m>. However, there does not exist an element in </m>z<m> in </m>{\mathbb
Z}[\sqrt{3}\, i ]<m> such that </m>\nu(z) = 2<m> because the equation </m>a^2 + 3
b^2 = 2$ has no integer solutions. Therefore, 2 must be irreducible. A
similar argument shows that both <m>1 - \sqrt{3}\, i</m> and <m>1 + \sqrt{3}\, i</m>
are irreducible. Since 2 is not a unit multiple of either $1 - 
\sqrt{3}\, i<m> or </m>1 + \sqrt{3}\, i$, 4 has at least two distinct
factorizations into irreducible elements.

<proof><p>
(1)
Suppose that <m>a \mid b</m>. Then <m>b = ax</m> for some <m>x \in D</m>. Hence, for
every <m>r</m> in <m>D</m>, <m>br =(ax)r = a(xr)</m> and $\langle b \rangle \subset

Consequently, <m>b =a x</m> for some <m>x \in D</m>.  Thus, <m>a \mid b</m>.
 

(2)
Since <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are associates, there exists a unit <m>u</m> such that 
<m>a = u b</m>.  Therefore, <m>b \mid a</m> and $\langle a \rangle \subset 
\langle b \rangle<m>. Similarly, </m>\langle b \rangle \subset \langle a 
\rangle<m>. It follows that </m>\langle a \rangle = \langle b \rangle$.
Conversely, suppose that $\langle a \rangle = \langle b
\rangle<m>. By part (1), </m>a \mid b<m> and </m>b \mid a<m>. Then </m>a = bx<m> and </m>b
= ay<m> for some </m>x, y \in D<m>. Therefore, </m>a = bx = ayx<m>. Since </m>D$ is

a \rangle<m> or </m>\langle p \rangle = \langle a \rangle$.  Consequently,
either <m>a</m> and <m>p</m> are associates or <m>a</m> is a unit.  Therefore, <m>p</m>

Conversely, let <m>p</m> be irreducible. If <m>\langle a \rangle</m> is an

We claim that <m>I= \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty I_i</m> is an ideal of <m>D</m>. Certainly

<em>Existence of a factorization.</em>
Let <m>D</m> be a PID and <m>a</m> be a nonzero element in <m>D</m> that is not a
unit. If <m>a</m> is irreducible, then we are done. If not, then there
exists a factorization <m>a = a_1 b_1</m>, where neither <m>a_1</m> nor <m>b_1</m> is
a unit. Hence, <m>\langle a \rangle \subset \langle a_1 \rangle</m>. By
Lemma<nbsp /><xref ref="domains:PI_lemma" />, we know that <m>\langle a \rangle \neq \langle a_1 \rangle</m>;
otherwise, <m>a</m> and <m>a_1</m> would be associates and <m>b_1</m> would be a unit,
which would contradict our assumption. Now suppose that $a_1 =  a_2
b_2<m>, where neither </m>a_2<m> nor </m>b_2$ is a unit. By the same argument as
before, <m>\langle a_1 \rangle \subset \langle a_2 \rangle</m>.  We can
continue with this construction to obtain an ascending chain of ideals
<me>
\langle a \rangle \subset \langle a_1 \rangle \subset \langle a_2
\rangle \subset \cdots.
</me>
By Lemma<nbsp /><xref ref="domains:ACC_lemma" />, there exists a positive integer <m>N</m> such that
<m>\langle a_n \rangle = \langle a_N \rangle</m> for all <m>n \geq N</m>. 
Consequently, <m>a_N</m> must be irreducible. We have now shown that <m>a</m> is
the product of two elements, one of which must be irreducible.

Now suppose that <m>a = c_1 p_1</m>, where <m>p_1</m> is irreducible. If <m>c_1</m>
is not a unit, we can repeat the preceding argument to conclude that
<m>\langle a \rangle \subset \langle c_1 \rangle</m>. Either <m>c_1</m> is
irreducible or <m>c_1 = c_2 p_2</m>, where <m>p_2</m> is irreducible and <m>c_2</m>
is not a unit.  Continuing in this manner, we obtain another chain of
ideals
<me>
\langle a \rangle \subset \langle c_1 \rangle \subset \langle c_2
\rangle \subset \cdots.	   
</me>
This chain must satisfy the ascending chain condition; therefore, 
<me>
a = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_r
</me>
for irreducible elements <m>p_1, \ldots, p_r</m>.


<em>Uniqueness of the factorization.</em>
To show uniqueness, let
<me>
a= p_1 p_2 \cdots p_r = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_s,
</me>
where each <m>p_i</m> and each <m>q_i</m> is irreducible.  Without loss of
generality, we can assume that <m>r \lt s</m>. Since <m>p_1</m> divides $q_1 q_2
\cdots q_s<m>, by Corollary<nbsp /><xref ref="domains:irredPIDcorollary" /> it must divide some </m>q_i$. By
rearranging the <m>q_i</m>'s, we can assume that <m>p_1 \mid q_1</m>; hence,
<m>q_1 = u_1 p_1</m> for some unit <m>u_1</m> in <m>D</m>. Therefore,
<me>
a = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_r = u_1 p_1 q_2 \cdots q_s
</me>
or 
<me>
p_2 \cdots p_r = u_1 q_2 \cdots q_s.
</me>
Continuing in this manner, we can arrange the <m>q_i</m>'s such that $p_2
= q_2, p_3 = q_3, \ldots, p_r = q_r$, to obtain
<me>
u_1 u_2 \cdots u_r q_{r+1} \cdots q_s = 1.
</me>
In this case <m>q_{r+1} \cdots q_s</m> is a unit, which contradicts the
fact that <m>q_{r+1}, \ldots, q_s</m> are irreducibles. Therefore, <m>r=s</m>
and the factorization of <m>a</m> is unique.

Every PID is a UFD, but it is not the case that every UFD is a PID. In Corollary<nbsp /><xref ref="domains:int_poly_UFD_corollary" />, we will prove that <m>{\mathbb Z}[x]</m> is a UFD.  However,
<m>{\mathbb Z}[x]</m> is not a PID.  Let <m>I = \{ 5 f(x) + x g(x) : f(x), g(x)  \in {\mathbb Z}[x] \}</m>.  We can easily show that <m>I</m> is an ideal of 
<m>{\mathbb Z}[x]</m>.  Suppose that <m>I = \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.  Since <m>5 \in I</m>,  <m>5 = f(x) p(x)</m>.  In this case <m>p(x) = p</m> must be a constant.

We have repeatedly used the division algorithm when proving results about either <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> or <m>F[x]</m>, where <m>F</m> is a field.  We

Let <m>D</m> be an integral domain such that for each <m>a \in D</m> there is  a nonnegative integer <m>\nu(a)</m>\label{notevaluation} satisfying the

</li><li>
Let <m>a, b \in D</m> and suppose that <m>b \neq 0</m>. Then there exist elements <m>q, r \in D</m> such that <m>a = bq +r</m> and either <m>r=0</m> or
<m>\nu(r) \lt \nu(b)</m>. 
 
\end{enumerate}
Then <m>D</m> is called a <term>Euclidean domain</term><index><main>Euclidean domain</main></index><index><main>Domain</main><sub>Euclidean</sub></index> and <m>\nu</m> is called a <term>Euclidean valuation</term><index><main>Euclidean valuation</main></index>.

{\mathbb Z}[i] = \{  a + b i : a, b \in {\mathbb Z} \}.
</me>
We usually measure the size of a complex number <m>a + bi</m> by its absolute value, <m>|a + bi| = \sqrt{ a^2 + b^2}</m>; however, <m>\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}</m> may not be an integer. For our valuation we will let <m>\nu(a + bi) = a^2 + b^2</m> to ensure that we have an integer.  

We claim that <m>\nu( a+ bi) = a^2 + b^2</m> is a Euclidean valuation on <m>{\mathbb Z}[i]</m>. Let <m>z, w \in {\mathbb Z}[i]</m>.  Then $\nu( zw) = |zw|^2 =

Next, we must show that for any <m>z= a+bi</m> and <m>w = c+di</m> in <m>{\mathbb Z}[i]</m> with <m>w \neq 0</m>, there exist elements <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> in

the closest integer <m>m_i</m> such that the fractional part satisfies <m>|n_i / (a^2 + b^2)| \leq 1/2</m>.  For example, we write 
<md><mrow>
\frac{9}{8} &amp; = 1 + \frac{1}{8}</mrow><mrow>
\frac{15}{8} &amp; = 2 - \frac{1}{8}.

Thus, <m>s</m> and <m>t</m> are the <q>fractional parts</q> of <m>z w^{-1} = (m_1 + m_2 i) + (s + ti)</m>. We also know that $s^2 + t^2 \leq 1/4 + 1/4 =

</me>
Let <m>b = b_1 \cdots b_n</m>. Since <m>g_1(x) \cdots g_n(x)</m> is primitive,
<m>a_1 \cdots a_n</m> divides <m>b</m>. Therefore, $p(x) = a g_1(x) \cdots
g_n(x)<m>, where </m>a \in D<m>. Since </m>D<m> is a UFD, we can factor </m>a<m> as </m>u
c_1 \cdots c_k<m>, where </m>u<m> is a unit and each of the </m>c_i$'s is
irreducible in <m>D</m>. 


We will now show the uniqueness of this factorization. Let
<me>
p(x) = a_1 \cdots a_m f_1(x) \cdots f_n(x) = b_1 \cdots b_r g_1(x)
\cdots g_s(x)
</me>
be two factorizations of <m>p(x)</m>, where all of the factors are
irreducible in <m>D[x]</m>.  By Corollary<nbsp /><xref ref="domains:irred_poly_lemma" />, each of the <m>f_i</m>'s and
<m>g_i</m>'s is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>. The <m>a_i</m>'s and the <m>b_i</m>'s are
units in <m>F</m>. Since <m>F[x]</m> is a PID, it is a UFD; therefore, <m>n=s</m>.
Now rearrange the <m>g_i(x)</m>'s so that <m>f_i(x)</m> and <m>g_i(x)</m> are
associates for <m>i = 1, \ldots, n</m>.  Then there exist $c_1, \ldots,
c_n<m> and </m>d_1, \ldots, d_n<m> in </m>D<m> such that </m>(c_i / d_i) f_i(x) =
g_i(x)<m> or </m>c_i f_i(x) = d_i g_i(x)<m>. The polynomials </m>f_i(x)$ and
<m>g_i(x)</m> are primitive; hence, <m>c_i</m> and <m>d_i</m> are associates in <m>D</m>.
Thus, <m>a_1 \cdots a_m = u b_1 \cdots b_r</m> in <m>D</m>, where <m>u</m> is a unit
in <m>D</m>. Since <m>D</m> is a unique factorization domain, <m>m =s</m>. Finally,
we can reorder the <m>b_i</m>'s so that <m>a_i</m> and <m>b_i</m> are associates for
each <m>i</m>. This completes the uniqueness part of the proof.

The theorem that we have just proven has several obvious but important 
corollaries.

It is important to notice that every Euclidean domain is a PID and
every PID is a UFD. However, as demonstrated by our examples, the
converse of each of these statements fails.  There are principal
ideal domains that are not Euclidean domains, and there are unique
factorization domains that are not principal ideal domains (${\mathbb
Z}[x]$). 


\noindent
Karl Friedrich Gauss<index><main>Gauss, Karl Friedrich</main></index>, born in Brunswick, Germany on April 30, 1777, is considered to be one of the greatest
mathematicians who ever lived.  Gauss was truly a child prodigy.  At the age of three he was able to detect errors in the books of his father's
business.  Gauss entered college at the age of 15.  Before the age of 20, Gauss was able to construct a regular 17-sided polygon with a ruler
and compass.  This was the first new construction of a regular <m>n</m>-sided polygon since the time of the ancient Greeks.  Gauss succeeded in showing that if <m>N= 2^{2^n}+1</m> was prime, then it was possible to construct a regular <m>N</m>-sided polygon.  

Gauss obtained his Ph.D. in 1799 under the direction of Pfaff at the University of Helmstedt.  In his dissertation he gave the first complete proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, which states that every polynomial with real coefficients can be factored into linear factors over the complex numbers.  The acceptance of complex numbers was brought about by Gauss, who was the first person to use the notation of <m>i</m> for <m>\sqrt{-1}</m>. 

Gauss then turned his attention toward number theory; in 1801, he published his famous book on number theory, \textit{Disquisitiones
Arithmeticae}.  Throughout his life Gauss was intrigued with this branch of mathematics.  He once wrote, <q>Mathematics is the queen of the sciences, and the theory of numbers is the queen of mathematics.</q> 

In 1807, Gauss was appointed director of the Observatory at the University of G\"{o}ttingen, a position he held until his death.  This position required him to study applications of mathematics to the sciences.  He succeeded in making contributions to fields such as astronomy, mechanics, optics, geodesy, and magnetism.  Along with Wilhelm Weber, he coinvented the first practical electric telegraph some years before a better version was invented by Samuel F. B. Morse. 

Gauss was clearly the most prominent mathematician in the world in the early nineteenth century. His status naturally made his discoveries
subject to intense scrutiny.  Gauss's  cold and distant personality many times led him to ignore the work of his contemporaries, making him many enemies.  He did not enjoy teaching very much, and young mathematicians who sought him out for encouragement were often
rebuffed.  Nevertheless, he had many outstanding students, including Eisenstein, Riemann, Kummer, Dirichlet, and Dedekind. Gauss also
offered a great deal of encouragement to Sophie Germain (1776<ndash />1831), who overcame the many obstacles facing women in her day to become a very prominent mathematician.  Gauss died at the age of 78 in G\"{o}ttingen on February 23, 1855.
