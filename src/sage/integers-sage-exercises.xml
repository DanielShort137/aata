These exercises are about investigating basic properties of the integers, something we will frequently do when investigating groups.  Use the editing capabilities of a Sage worksheet to annotate and explain your work.

<exercise number="1">
<statement>
<p>
Use the <c>next_prime()</c> command to construct two different 8-digit prime numbers.
</p>
</statement>
<sage />
</exercise>

<exercise number="2">
<statement>
<p>
Use the <c>.is_prime()</c> method to verify that your primes are really prime.
</p>
</statement>

</exercise>

<exercise number="3">
<statement>
<p>
Verify that the greatest common divisor of your two primes is 1.

<exercise number="4">
<statement>
<p>
Find two integers that make a <q>linear combination</q> of your primes equal to 1.  Include a verification of your result.

<exercise number="5">
<statement>
<p>
Determine a factorization into powers of primes for <m>b=4\,598\,037\,234</m>.
</p>
</statement>
<sage />
</exercise>

<exercise number="6">
<statement>
<p>
Write statements that show that <m>b</m> is (i) divisible by 7, (ii) not divisible by 11.  Your statements should simply return <c>True</c> or <c>False</c> and be sufficiently general that a different value of <m>b</m> or different candidate prime divisors could be easily used by making just one substitution for each changed value.
