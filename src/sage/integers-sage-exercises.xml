	<title>Sage Exercises</title>

	<introduction>
		<p>These exercises are about investigating basic properties of the integers, something we will frequently do when investigating groups.  Use the editing capabilities of a Sage worksheet to annotate and explain your work.</p>
	</introduction>

	<exercise number="1">
		<statement>
			<p>Use the <c>next_prime()</c> command to construct two different 8-digit prime numbers.</p>
		</statement>
	</exercise>

	<exercise number="2">
		<statement>
			<p>Use the <c>.is_prime()</c> method to verify that your primes are really prime.</p>
		</statement>
	</exercise>

	<exercise number="3">
		<statement>
			<p>Verify that the greatest common divisor of your two primes is <m>1</m>.</p>
		</statement>
	</exercise>

	<exercise number="4">
		<statement>
			<p>Find two integers that make a <q>linear combination</q> of your primes equal to <m>1</m>.  Include a verification of your result.</p>
		</statement>
	</exercise>

	<exercise number="5">
		<statement>
			<p>Determine a factorization into powers of primes for <m>b=4\,598\,037\,234</m>.</p>
		</statement>
	</exercise>

	<exercise number="6">
		<statement>
			<p>Write statements that show that <m>b</m> is (i) divisible by 7, (ii) not divisible by 11.  Your statements should simply return <c>True</c> or <c>False</c> and be <em>sufficiently general</em> that a different value of <m>b</m> or different candidate prime divisors could be easily used by making just one substitution/edit for each changed value.</p>
		</statement>
	</exercise>
