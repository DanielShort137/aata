	<exercise number="1">
		<statement>
			<p>This exercise is just about making sure you know how to use Sage.  Login to a Sage Notebook server and create a new worksheet.  Do some non-trivial computation, maybe a pretty plot or some gruesome numerical computation to an insane precision.   Create an interesting list and experiment with it some.  Maybe include some nicely formatted text or <tex/> using the included mini-word-processor of the Sage Notebook (hover until a blue bar appears between cells and then shift-click).</p>

			<p>Use whatever mechanism your instructor has in place for submitting your work.  Or save your worksheet and then trade worksheets via email (or another electronic method) with a classmate.</p>
