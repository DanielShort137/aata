	<title>Sage</title>

	<p>Sage has many commands related to conjugacy, which is a group action.  It also has commands for orbits and stabilizers of permutation groups.  In the supplement, we illustrate the automorphism group of a (combinatorial) graph as another example of a group action on the vertex set of the graph.</p>
