	<title>Sage</title>

	<p>Sage is able to create direct products of cyclic groups, though they are realized as permutation groups.  This is a situation that should improve.  However, with a classification of finite abelian groups, we can describe how to construct in Sage every group of order less than <m>16</m>.</p>
