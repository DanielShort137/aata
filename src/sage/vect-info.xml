	<title>Sage</title>

	<p>Many of Sage's computations, in a wide variety of algebraic settings, come from solving problems in linear algebra.  So you will find a wealth of linear algebra functionality.  Further, you can use structures such as finite fields to find vector spaces in new settings.</p>
