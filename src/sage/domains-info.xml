	<title>Sage</title>

	<p>Sage supports distinctions between <q>plain</q> rings, domains, principal ideal domains and fields.  Support is often very good for constructions and computations with PID's, but sometimes problems get significantly harder (computationally) when a ring has less structure that that of a PID.  So be aware when using Sage that some questions may go unanswered for rings with less structure.</p>
