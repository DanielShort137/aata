	<p>Extensions of the field of rational numbers are a central object of study in number theory, so with Sage's roots in this discipline, it is no surprise that there is extensive support for fields and for extensions of the rationals.  Sage also contains an implementation of the entire field of algebraic numbers, with exact representations.</p>
