These exercises are designed to help you become familiar with permutation groups in Sage.

<exercise number="1">
<statement>
<p>
Create the full symmetric group <m>S_{10}</m> with the command <c>G = SymmetricGroup(10)</c>.
</p>
</statement>
<sage />
</exercise>

<exercise number="2">
<statement>
<p>
Create elements of <c>G</c> with the following (varying) syntax.  Pay attention to commas, quotes, brackets, parentheses.  The first two use a string (characters) as input, mimicking the way we write permuations (but with commas).  The second two use a list of tuples.</p><p>\noindent
<c>a = G("(5,7,2,9,3,1,8)")</c>\\
<c>b = G("(1,3)(4,5)")</c>\\
<c>c = G([(1,2),(3,4)])</c>\\
<c>d = G([(1,3),(2,5,8),(4,6,7,9,10)])</c></p><p>\noindent

(a)  Compute <m>a^3</m>, <m>bc</m>, <m>ad^{-1}b</m>.</p><p>\noindent

(b)  Compute the orders of each of these four individual elements (<c>a</c> through <c>d</c>) using a single permutation group element method.</p><p>\noindent

(c)  Use the permutation group element method <c>.sign()</c> to determine if <m>a,b,c,d</m> are even or odd permutations.</p><p>\noindent

(d)  Create two cyclic subgroups of <m>G</m> with the commands:

<ul>
</li><li><c>H = G.subgroup([a])</c>
</li><li><c>K = G.subgroup([d])</c>
</ul>

List, and study, the elements of each subgroup.  Without using Sage, list the order of each subgroup of <m>K</m>.  Then use Sage to construct a subgroup of <m>K</m> with order 10.</p><p>\noindent

(e)  More complicated subgroups can be formed by using two or more generators.  Construct a subgroup <m>L</m> of <m>G</m> with the command <c>L = G.subgroup([b,c])</c>.  Compute the order of <m>L</m> and list all of the elements of <m>L</m>.
</p>
</statement>
<sage />
</exercise>

<exercise number="3">
<statement>
<p>
Construct the group of symmetries of the tetrahedron (also the alternating group on 4 symbols, <m>A_4</m>) with the command <c>A=AlternatingGroup(4)</c>.  Using tools such as orders of elements, and generators of subgroups, see if you can find <em>all of</em> the subgroups of <m>A_4</m> (each one exactly once).  Do this without using the <c>.subgroups()</c> method to justify the correctness of your answer (though it might be a convenient way to check your work).</p><p>

Provide a nice summary as your answer - not just piles of output.  So use Sage as a tool, as needed, but basically your answer will be a concise paragraph and/or table.  This is the one part of this assignment without clear, precise directions, so spend some time on this portion to get it right.  Hint: no subgroup of <m>A_4</m> requires more than two generators.

<exercise number="4">
<statement>
<p>
Save your work, and then see if you can crash your Sage session with the commands.  Do not submit the list of elements of <c>N</c> as part of your submitted worksheet.

<ul>
</li><li><c>N = G.subgroup([b,d])</c>
</li><li><c>N.list()</c>
</ul>

How big is <m>N</m>?
