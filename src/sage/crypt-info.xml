	<p>Sage's early development featured powerful routines for number theory, and later included significant support for algebraic structures and other areas of discrete mathematics.  So it is a natural tool for the study of cryptology, including topics like RSA, elliptic curve cryptography, and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).</p>
