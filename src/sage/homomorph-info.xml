	<title>Sage</title>

	<p>Sage can create homomorphisms between groups, which can be used directly as functions, and then queried for their kernels and images.  So there is great potential for exploring the many fundamental relationships between groups, normal subgroups, quotient groups and properties of homomorphisms.</p>
