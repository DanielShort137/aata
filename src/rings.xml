</introduction>
 
Up to this point we have studied sets with a single binary operation
satisfying certain axioms, but often we are more interested in working
with sets that have two binary operations.  For example, one of the
most natural algebraic structures to study is the integers 
with the operations of addition and multiplication. These operations
are related to one another by the distributive
property. If we consider a set with two such related binary operations
satisfying certain axioms, we have an algebraic structure called a
ring. In a ring we add and multiply such elements as real numbers,
complex numbers, matrices, and functions.

<title>Rings</title>

A nonempty set <m>R</m> is a <term>ring</term><index><main>Ring</main><sub>definition of</sub></index> if
it has two closed binary operations, addition and multiplication,
satisfying the following conditions.  
\begin{enumerate}
 
</li><li>
<m>a + b = b + a</m> for <m>a, b \in R</m>.
 
</li><li>
<m>(a + b) + c = a + ( b + c)</m> for <m>a, b, c  \in R</m>.
 
</li><li>
There is an element <m>0</m> in <m>R</m> such that <m>a + 0 = a</m> for all $a \in
R$. 
 
</li><li>
For every element <m>a \in R</m>, there exists an element <m>-a</m> in <m>R</m> such
that <m>a + (-a) = 0</m>. 
 
</li><li>
<m>(ab)  c = a  ( b  c)</m> for <m>a, b, c  \in R</m>.
 
</li><li>
For <m>a, b, c \in R</m>,
<md><mrow>
a( b + c)&amp;= ab +ac</mrow><mrow>
(a + b)c &amp; = ac + bc.
</mrow></md>
 
\end{enumerate}
This last condition, the distributive axiom, relates the binary
operations of addition and multiplication. Notice that the first four
axioms simply require that a ring be an abelian group under addition,
so we could also have defined a ring to be an abelian group
<m>(R, +)</m> together with a second binary operation satisfying the fifth
and sixth conditions given above.  
 
 
If there is an element <m>1 \in R</m> such that <m>1 \neq 0</m> and  $1a = a1 =
a<m> for each element </m>a \in R<m>, we say that </m>R$ is a ring with <term> unity</term><index><main>Ring</main><sub>with unity</sub></index> or <term>identity</term>\index{Ring!with

b<m> in </m>R$ is called a <term>commutative ring</term><index><main>Ring</main><sub>commutative</sub></index><index><main>Commutative rings</main></index>. A commutative
ring <m>R</m> with identity is called an <term>integral domain</term><index><main>Integral domain</main></index> if, for every <m>a, b  \in R</m> such that
<m>ab = 0</m>, either <m>a = 0</m> or <m>b = 0</m>.  A <term>division ring</term><index><main>Division ring</main></index><index><main>Ring</main><sub>division</sub></index> is a ring <m>R</m>, with an

exists a unique element <m>a^{-1}</m> such that <m>a^{-1} a = a a^{-1}  = 1</m>.
A commutative division ring is called a <term>field</term><index><main>Field</main></index>. 
The relationship among rings, integral domains, division rings, and
fields is shown in Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="Rings" />.

<example xml:id="integer_ring">
<p>
As we have mentioned previously, the integers form a ring. In fact, ${\mathbb
Z}<m> is an integral domain.  Certainly if </m>a b = 0$ for two integers
<m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, either <m>a=0</m> or <m>b=0</m>. However, <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> is not a
field. There is no integer that is the multiplicative inverse of 2,
since <m>1/2</m> is not an integer.  The only integers with multiplicative
inverses are 1 and <m>-1</m>.  
</p>
</example>
 
 
<example xml:id="field_ring">
<p>
Under the ordinary operations of addition and multiplication, all of
the familiar number systems are rings: the rationals, <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>; the
real numbers, <m>{\mathbb R}</m>; and the complex numbers, <m>{\mathbb C}</m>. Each of
these rings is a field. 
</p>
</example>
 
 
<example xml:id="Zn_rings">
<p>
We can define the product of two elements <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>
by <m>ab~\pmod{n}</m>. For instance, in <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m>,  $5 \cdot 7 \equiv
11 \pmod{12}<m>.  This product makes the abelian group </m>{\mathbb Z}_n$ into
a ring. Certainly <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> is a commutative ring; however, it may
fail to be an integral domain.  If we consider $3 \cdot 4 \equiv 0
\pmod{12}<m> in </m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}$, it is easy to see that a product of two 
nonzero elements in the ring can be equal to zero.  
</p>
</example>

 
 
A nonzero element <m>a</m> in a ring <m>R</m> is called a <term>zero divisor</term><index><main>Zero divisor</main></index> if there is a nonzero element <m>b</m> in <m>R</m>
such that <m>ab = 0</m>. In the previous example,  3 and 4 are zero
divisors in <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m>.  
 
 
<example xml:id="function_ring">
<p>
In calculus the continuous real-valued functions on an interval
<m>[a,b]</m> form a commutative ring. We add or multiply two functions by 
adding or multiplying the values of the functions.  If <m>f(x) = x^2</m> and
<m>g(x) = \cos x</m>, then <m>(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) = x^2 + \cos x</m> and
<m>(fg)(x) = f(x) g(x) = x^2 \cos x</m>.

</p>
</example>
 
 
<example xml:id="matrix_ring">
<p>
The <m>2 \times 2</m> matrices  with entries in <m>{\mathbb R}</m> form a ring
under the usual operations of matrix addition and multiplication. This
ring is \mbox{noncommutative}, since it is usually the case that $AB \neq
BA<m>. Also, notice that we can have </m>AB = 0<m> when neither </m>A<m> nor </m>B$
is zero. 
</p>
</example>
 
 
<example xml:id="noncommute_ring">

For an example of a noncommutative division ring, let
<me>
1 = 
\begin{pmatrix}<![CDATA[

{\mathbf i}

{\mathbf j} =

\quad
{\mathbf k} = 
\begin{pmatrix}<![CDATA[
i & 0 \\

</me>
where <m>i^2 = -1</m>. These elements satisfy the following relations: 
<md><mrow>
{\mathbf i}^2 = {\mathbf j}^2 &amp; =  {\mathbf k}^2 = -1</mrow><mrow>
{\mathbf i}  {\mathbf j} &amp; =  {\mathbf k} </mrow><mrow>

{\mathbf k}  {\mathbf j} &amp; =  - {\mathbf i} </mrow><mrow>
{\mathbf i}  {\mathbf k} &amp; =  - {\mathbf j}. 
</mrow></md>
Let <m>{\mathbb H}</m>\label{noteringH} consist of elements of the form $a + b
{\mathbf i}  + c {\mathbf j} +d {\mathbf k}<m>, where </m>a, b , c, d$ are real
numbers. Equivalently, <m>{\mathbb H}</m> can be considered to be the set of
all <m>2 \times 2</m> matrices of the form  
<me>
\begin{pmatrix}<![CDATA[
\alpha & \beta \\
-\overline{\beta} & \overline{\alpha }
]]>\end{pmatrix},
</me>
where <m>\alpha = a + di</m> and <m>\beta = b+ci</m> are complex numbers. We can
define addition and multiplication on <m>{\mathbb H}</m> either by the usual matrix
operations or in terms of the generators 1, <m>{\mathbf i}</m>, <m>{\mathbf j}</m>,
and <m>{\mathbf k}</m>: 
\begin{multline*}
(a_1 + b_1 {\mathbf i}  + c_1 {\mathbf j} +d_1 {\mathbf k} )

(a_1 + a_2) + ( b_1 + b_2) {\mathbf i}  + ( c_1 + c_2)
{\mathbf j} + ( d_1 + d_2) {\mathbf k}
\end{multline*}
and
<me>
(a_1 + b_1 {\mathbf i}  + c_1 {\mathbf j} +d_1 {\mathbf k} ) ( a_2 + b_2
{\mathbf i}  + c_2 {\mathbf j} +d_2 {\mathbf k} ) = \alpha + \beta {\mathbf

</me>
where
<md><mrow>
\alpha &amp; =  a_1 a_2 - b_1 b_2 - c_1 c_2 -d_1 d_2</mrow><mrow>
\beta &amp; =  a_1 b_2 + a_2 b_1 + c_1 d_2 - d_1 c_2</mrow><mrow>

\delta &amp; =  a_1 d_2 + b_1 c_2 - c_1 b_2 - d_1 a_2.
</mrow></md>
Though multiplication looks complicated, it is actually a
straightforward computation if we remember that we just add and
multiply elements in <m>{\mathbb H}</m> like polynomials and keep in mind the
relationships between the generators <m>{\mathbf i}</m>, <m>{\mathbf j}</m>, and
<m>{\mathbf k}</m>. The ring <m>{\mathbb H}</m> is called the ring of <term> quaternions</term><index><main>Quaternions</main></index>.

<!-- Subscript error corrected.  Suggested by K. Halasz. -->
<!-- TWJ 2/6/2013  -->
 
 
To show that the quaternions are a division ring, we must be able to
find an inverse for each nonzero element. Notice that 
<me>
( a + b {\mathbf i}  + c {\mathbf j} +d {\mathbf k} )( a - b
{\mathbf i}  - c {\mathbf j}
-d {\mathbf k} ) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2.
</me>
This element can be zero only if <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>c</m>, and <m>d</m> are
all zero. So if $a + b {\mathbf i}  + c {\mathbf j} +d {\mathbf k}
\neq 0$,
<me>
( a + b {\mathbf i}  + c {\mathbf j} +d {\mathbf k} )
\left(
\frac{a - b {\mathbf i} - c {\mathbf j} - d {\mathbf k} }{ a^2 + b^2 + c^2
+ d^2 }
\right)
= 1.
</me>

To prove (1), observe that

a(b-b) = a0 = 0<m>; consequently, </m>-ab = a(-b)<m>. Similarly, </m>-ab =
(-a)b<m>. Part (3) follows directly from (2) since </m>(-a)(-b) = -(a(- b))
= -(-ab) = ab$. 
</p></proof>
 
 

 
 
Just as we have subgroups of groups, we have an analogous class of 
\mbox{substructures} for rings. A <term>subring</term><index><main>Subring</main></index> <m>S</m> 
of a ring
<m>R</m> is a subset <m>S</m> of <m>R</m> such that <m>S</m> is also a ring under the
inherited operations from <m>R</m>.
 
 
<example xml:id="subring_chain">
<p>
The ring <m>n {\mathbb Z}</m> is a subring of <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>.  Notice that even
though the original ring may have an identity, we do not require
that its subring have an identity. We have the following chain of
subrings: 
<me>
{\mathbb Z} \subset {\mathbb Q} \subset {\mathbb R} \subset {\mathbb C}.
</me>
</p>

The following proposition gives us some easy criteria for determining
whether or not a  subset of a ring is indeed a subring. (We will leave
the proof of this proposition as an exercise.)

<title>Integral Domains and Fields</title>
 
 
Let us briefly recall some definitions. If <m>R</m> is a ring and <m>r</m> is a
nonzero element in <m>R</m>, then <m>r</m> is said to  be a <term>zero divisor</term>
if there is some nonzero element <m>s \in R</m> such that <m>rs = 0</m>. A
commutative ring with identity is said to be an <term>integral domain</term> if it has no zero divisors.  If an element <m>a</m> in a ring <m>R</m>
with identity has a multiplicative inverse, we say that <m>a</m> is a <term> unit</term>. If every nonzero element in a ring <m>R</m> is a unit, then <m>R</m> is
called a <term>division ring</term>.  A commutative division ring is called
a <term>field</term>. 
 
 
<example xml:id="gaussian_ring">
<p>
If <m>i^2 = -1</m>, then the set ${\mathbb Z}[ i ] = \{ m + ni : m, n \in
{\mathbb Z} \}$ forms a ring known as the <term>Gaussian integers</term><index><main>Gaussian integers</main></index>\label{gaussianintegers}. It is
easily seen that the Gaussian integers are a subring of the complex
numbers since they are closed under addition and multiplication. Let
<m>\alpha = a + bi</m> be a unit in <m>{\mathbb Z}[ i ]</m>. Then
<m>\overline{\alpha} = a - bi</m> is also a unit since if $\alpha \beta =
1<m>, then </m>\overline{\alpha} \overline{\beta} = 1<m>. If </m>\beta = c +
di$, then   
<me>
1 = \alpha \beta \overline{\alpha} \overline{\beta} = (a^2 +
b^2 )(c^2
+ d^2).
</me>
Therefore, <m>a^2 + b^2</m> must either be 1 or <m>-1</m>; or, equivalently, $a
+ bi = \pm 1<m> or </m>a+ bi = \pm i$.  Therefore, units of this ring are
<m>\pm 1</m> and <m>\pm i</m>; hence, the Gaussian integers are not a field. We
will leave it as an exercise to prove that the Gaussian integers are
an integral domain.

We have the following alternative characterization of integral
domains. 
 
 

 
 
<proposition>
<title>Cancellation Law</title>
<statement>
<p><index><main>Cancellation law</main><sub>for integral domains</sub></index>
Let <m>D</m> be a commutative ring with identity. Then <m>D</m> is an integral
domain if and only if for all nonzero elements <m>a \in D</m> with $ab =
ac<m>, we have </m>b=c$. 
</p>
FIXME-MOVE-IN-PROOF</statement>
</proposition>
 
 
<proof><p>
Let <m>D</m> be an integral domain. Then <m>D</m> has no zero divisors.  Let $ab
= ac<m> with </m>a \neq 0<m>. Then </m>a(b - c) =0<m>.  Hence, </m>b - c = 0<m> and </m>b
= c$. 
 
 
Conversely, let us suppose that cancellation is possible in <m>D</m>.
That is, suppose that <m>ab = ac</m> implies <m>b=c</m>. Let <m>ab = 0</m>.  If $a
\neq 0<m>, then </m>ab = a 0<m> or </m>b=0<m>.  Therefore, </m>a$ cannot be a zero
divisor. 
</p></proof>
 
 

 
 
The following surprising theorem is due to Wedderburn.
 
 
<theorem>
<statement>
<p>
Every finite integral domain is a field.
</p>
FIXME-MOVE-IN-PROOF</statement>
</theorem>
 
 
<proof><p>
Let <m>D</m> be a finite integral domain and <m>D^\ast</m> be the set of nonzero
elements of <m>D</m>.  We must show that every element in <m>D^*</m> has an
inverse. For each <m>a \in D^\ast</m> we can define a map $\lambda_a :
D^\ast \rightarrow D^\ast<m> by </m>\lambda_a(d) = ad$.  This map makes
sense, because if  <m>a \neq 0</m> and <m>d \neq 0</m>, then <m>ad \neq 0</m>.  The map
<m>\lambda_a</m> is one-to-one, since for <m>d_1, d_2 \in D^*</m>, 
<me>
ad_1 = \lambda_a(d_1) = \lambda_a(d_2) = ad_2
</me>
implies <m>d_1 = d_2</m> by left cancellation. Since <m>D^\ast</m> is a finite
set, the map <m>\lambda_a</m> must also be onto; hence, for some $d \in
D^\ast<m>, </m>\lambda_a(d) = ad = 1<m>. Therefore, </m>a$ has a left inverse.
Since <m>D</m> is commutative, <m>d</m> must also be a right inverse for <m>a</m>.
Consequently, <m>D</m> is a field. 
</p></proof>
 
 

 
 
For any nonnegative integer <m>n</m> and any element <m>r</m> in a ring <m>R</m> we 
write <m>r + \cdots + r</m> (<m>n</m> times) as <m>nr</m>. We  define the <term> characteristic</term>\index{Characteristic of a

be the least positive integer <m>n</m> such that <m>nr=0</m> for all <m>r \in R</m>.
If no such integer exists, then the characteristic of <m>R</m> is defined
to be 0.

For every prime <m>p</m>, <m>{\mathbb Z}_p</m> is a field of characteristic <m>p</m>. By

hence, <m>{\mathbb Z}_p</m> is a field. If <m>a</m> is any nonzero element in the

<proof><p>
Let <m>D</m> be an integral domain and suppose that the characteristic of

<m>1 \lt a \lt n</m> and <m>1 \lt b \lt n</m>. By Lemma<nbsp /><xref ref="rings:char_lemma" />, we need only consider the case <m>n 1 = 0</m>.  Since <m>0 = n 1 = (ab)1 = (a1)(b1)</m> and
there are no zero divisors in <m>D</m>, either <m>a1 =0</m> or <m>b1=0</m>. Hence,
the characteristic of <m>D</m> must be less than <m>n</m>, which is a

<title>Ring Homomorphisms and Ideals</title>
 
 
In the study of groups, a homomorphism is a map that preserves the
operation of the group.  Similarly, a homomorphism between rings
preserves the operations of addition and multiplication in the ring.
More specifically, if  <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> are rings, then   a <term>ring homomorphism</term><index><main>Homomorphism</main><sub>ring</sub></index><index><main>Ring</main><sub>homomorphism</sub></index> is a
map <m>\phi : R \rightarrow S</m> satisfying  
<md><mrow>
\phi( a + b ) &amp; = \phi( a ) + \phi(b)</mrow><mrow>
\phi( a b ) &amp; = \phi( a ) \phi(b)
</mrow></md>
for all <m>a, b \in R</m>.  
If <m>\phi : R \rightarrow S</m> is a one-to-one and onto homomorphism,
then <m>\phi</m> is called an <term> isomorphism</term><index><main>Isomorphism</main><sub>ring</sub></index><index><main>Ring</main><sub>isomorphism</sub></index> of rings.   
 
 
The set of elements that a ring homomorphism maps to <m>0</m> plays a
fundamental role in the theory of rings. For any ring homomorphism
<m>\phi : R \rightarrow S</m>, we define the <term> kernel</term><index><main>Homomorphism</main><sub>kernel of a ring</sub></index>\index{Kernel!of a ring
homomorphism} of a ring homomorphism to be the set
<me>
\ker \phi = \{ r \in R : \phi( r ) = 0 \}.
</me>
 
 
<example xml:id="ring_homo">
<p>
For any integer <m>n</m> we can define a ring homomorphism $\phi~:~{\mathbb Z}
\rightarrow {\mathbb Z}_n<m> by </m>a \mapsto a \pmod{n}$. This is indeed a
ring homomorphism, since 
<md><mrow>
\phi( a + b )  &amp; = (a + b) \pmod{n}</mrow><mrow>
 &amp; =  a \pmod{n} + b \pmod{n}\\

 &amp; = a \pmod{n}\cdot  b \pmod{n}</mrow><mrow>
 &amp; = \phi( a ) \phi(b).
</mrow></md>
The kernel of the homomorphism <m>\phi</m> is <m>n {\mathbb Z}</m>.
</p>
</example>
 
 
<example xml:id="cont_function_homomorpj">
<p>
Let <m>C[a, b]</m> be the ring of continuous real-valued functions on an
interval <m>[a,b]</m> as in Example<nbsp /><xref ref="example:rings:function_ring" />. For a fixed  <m>\alpha \in [a, b]</m>,
we can define a ring homomorphism $\phi_{\alpha} : C[a, b] \rightarrow
{\mathbb R}<m> by </m>\phi_{\alpha} (f ) = f( \alpha)$. This  is a ring
homomorphism since 
<me>
\begin{array}{c}
\phi_{\alpha}( f + g )  = (f + g)( \alpha) = f(\alpha) + g(\alpha) =
\phi_{\alpha}( f ) + \phi_{\alpha}(g ) \\
\phi_{\alpha}( f  g )  = (f  g)( \alpha) = f(\alpha)  g(\alpha) =
\phi_{\alpha}( f )  \phi_{\alpha}(g ).

In group theory we found that normal subgroups play a special role.
These subgroups have nice characteristics that make them more
interesting to study than arbitrary subgroups.  In ring theory the
objects corresponding to normal subgroups are a special class of
subrings called ideals. An <term>ideal</term><index><main>Ideal</main><sub>definition of</sub></index>
in a ring <m>R</m> is a subring <m>I</m> of <m>R</m> such that if <m>a</m> is in <m>I</m> and
<m>r</m> is in <m>R</m>, then both <m>ar</m> and <m>ra</m> are in <m>I</m>; that is, $rI
\subset I<m> and </m>Ir \subset I<m> for all </m>r \in R$.

Let <m>R</m> be a ring with identity and suppose that <m>I</m> is an ideal in

two-sided ideals.

In this particular section we are especially interested in certain

rings. More specifically, we would like to characterize those ideals
<m>I</m> of a commutative ring <m>R</m> such that <m>R/I</m> is an integral domain or
a field.  
 
 
A proper ideal <m>M</m> of a ring <m>R</m> is a <term>maximal ideal</term><index><main>Ideal</main><sub>maximal</sub></index><index><main>Maximal ideal</main></index> of <m>R</m> if the ideal
<m>M</m> is not a proper subset of any ideal of <m>R</m> except <m>R</m> itself.
That is, <m>M</m> is a 
maximal ideal if for any ideal <m>I</m> properly containing <m>M</m>, <m>I = R</m>.
The following theorem completely characterizes maximal ideals for
commutative rings with identity in terms of their corresponding factor
rings.

</theorem>
 
 
<proof><p>
Let <m>M</m> be a maximal ideal in <m>R</m>. If <m>R</m> is a commutative ring, then
<m>R/M</m> must also be a commutative ring.  Clearly, <m>1 + M</m> acts as an
identity for <m>R/M</m>. We must also show that every nonzero element in
<m>R/M</m> has an inverse.  If <m>a+M</m> is a nonzero element in <m>R/M</m>, then $a
\notin M<m>. Define </m>I<m> to be the set </m>\{ ra +m : r \in R \mbox{ and } m
\in M \}<m>. We will show that </m>I<m> is an ideal in </m>R<m>. The set </m>I$ is
nonempty since <m>0a+0=0</m> is in <m>I</m>. If <m>r_1 a +m_1</m> and <m>r_2 a +m_2</m>
are two elements in <m>I</m>, then 
<me>
(r_1 a + m_1) - ( r_2 a +m_2) = (r_1 - r_2)a + (m_1 -m_2)
</me>
is in <m>I</m>. Also, for any <m>r \in R</m> it is true that <m>rI \subset I</m>;
hence, <m>I</m> is closed under multiplication and satisfies the
necessary conditions to be an ideal. Therefore, by Proposition<nbsp /><xref ref="rings:prop2" />
and the definition of an ideal, <m>I</m> is an ideal properly containing
<m>M</m>. Since <m>M</m> is a maximal ideal, <m>I=R</m>; consequently, by the
definition of <m>I</m> there must be an <m>m</m> in <m>M</m> and a <m>b</m> in <m>R</m> such that
<m>1=ab+m</m>. Therefore,

1 + M = ab + M = ba + M = (a+M)(b+M).

Conversely, suppose that <m>M</m> is an ideal and <m>R/M</m> is a field. Since
<m>R/M</m> is a field, it must contain at least two elements: <m>0 + M = M</m>
and <m>1 + M</m>. Hence, <m>M</m> is a proper ideal of <m>R</m>.  Let <m>I</m> be any
ideal properly containing <m>M</m>. We need to show that <m>I = R</m>. Choose
<m>a</m> in <m>I</m> but not in <m>M</m>. Since <m>a+ M</m> is a nonzero element in a
field, there exists an element <m>b +M</m> in <m>R/M</m> such that $(a+M)(b+M) =
ab + M = 1+M<m>.  Consequently, there exists an element </m>m \in M$ such
that <m>ab + m = 1</m> and <m>1</m> is in <m>I</m>. Therefore, <m>r1 =r \in I</m> for all

Then <m>ab \in P</m>. If <m>a \notin P</m>, then <m>b</m> must be in <m>P</m> by the

Every ideal in <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> is of the form <m>n {\mathbb Z}</m>.  The factor

only when <m>n</m> is prime.  It is actually a field.  Hence, the nonzero

Amalie Emmy Noether<index><main>Noether, A. Emmy</main></index>, one of the  outstanding
mathematicians of the twentieth century, was born in Erlangen, Germany in 1882.
She was the daughter of Max Noether<index><main>Noether, Max</main></index> (1844<ndash />1921),
a distinguished mathematician at the University of Erlangen. Together 
with Paul Gordon (1837<ndash />1912), Emmy Noether's father strongly influenced
her early education. She entered the University of Erlangen
at the age of 18. Although women had been admitted to
universities in England, France, and Italy for decades, there was
great resistance to their presence at universities in Germany.
Noether was one of only two women among the university's 986 students.
After completing her doctorate under Gordon in 1907, she continued to
do research at Erlangen, occasionally lecturing when her father was
ill.  
<!-- Updated to say that Noether lived in the 20th century and not the current (21st century). -->
<!-- Suggested by K. Halasz. -->
<!-- TWJ 2/5/2013 -->
 
 
Noether went to G\"{o}ttingen to study in 1916. David
Hilbert<index><main>Hilbert, David</main></index> and Felix Klein<index><main>Klein, Felix</main></index>
tried unsuccessfully to secure her an appointment at
G\"{o}ttingen. Some of the faculty objected to women lecturers, saying, 
<q>What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and
are expected to learn at the feet of a woman?</q>  Hilbert, annoyed at
the question, responded, <q>Meine Herren, I do not see that the sex of
a candidate is an argument against her admission as a Privatdozent.
After all, the Senate is not a bathhouse.</q>  At the end of World War
I, attitudes changed and conditions greatly improved for women.  After
Noether passed her habilitation examination in 1919, she was given a
title and was paid a small sum for her lectures. 
 
 
In 1922, Noether became a Privatdozent at G\"{o}ttingen. Over the
next 11 years she used axiomatic methods to develop an abstract 
theory of rings and ideals. Though she was not good at lecturing,
Noether was an inspiring teacher. One of her many students was B. L.
van der Waerden, author of the first text treating abstract algebra
from a modern point of view. Some of the other mathematicians 
Noether influenced or closely worked with were Alexandroff, Artin,
Brauer, Courant, Hasse, Hopf, Pontryagin, von Neumann, and Weyl. One
of the high points of her career was an invitation to address the
International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich in 1932. In spite 
of all the recognition she received from her colleagues, Noether's
abilities were never recognized as they should have been during her
lifetime. She was never promoted to full professor by the Prussian
academic bureaucracy.
 
 
In 1933, Noether, a Jew, was banned from participation in all academic
activities in Germany. She emigrated to the United States, took a
position at Bryn Mawr College, and became a member of the Institute
for Advanced Study at Princeton. Noether died suddenly on April 14,
1935. After her death she was eulogized by such notable
scientists as Albert Einstein.

The Chinese Remainder Theorem is a result from elementary number
theory about the solution of systems of simultaneous congruences. The 
Chinese mathematician Sun-ts\"{\i} wrote about the theorem in the
first century A.D\@. This theorem has some interesting
consequences in the design of software for parallel processors.

</p>
FIXME-MOVE-IN-PROOF</statement>
</lemma>
 
 
<proof><p>
The equation <m>x \equiv a \pmod{m}</m> has a solution since <m>a +km</m>
satisfies the equation for all <m>k \in {\mathbb Z}</m>.  We must show that
there exists an integer <m>k_1</m> such that 
<me>
a + k_1 m \equiv b \pmod{n}.
</me>
This is equivalent to showing that 
<me>
k_1 m \equiv (b-a) \pmod{n}
</me>
has a solution for <m>k_1</m>.  Since <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are relatively prime,
there exist integers <m>s</m> and <m>t</m> such that <m>ms + nt = 1</m>.
Consequently, 
<me>
(b-a) ms = (b-a) -(b-a) nt,

<me>
[(b-a)s]m \equiv (b-a) \pmod{n}.

Now let <m>k_1 = (b-a)s</m>.
 
 
To show that any two solutions are congruent modulo <m>mn</m>, let <m>c_1</m> and
<m>c_2</m> be two solutions of  the system. That is,
<md><mrow>
c_i &amp; \equiv  a \pmod{m}</mrow><mrow>
c_i &amp; \equiv  b \pmod{n}

for <m>i = 1, 2</m>. Then
<md><mrow>
c_2 &amp; \equiv  c_1 \pmod{m}</mrow><mrow>
c_2 &amp; \equiv  c_1 \pmod{n}. 
</mrow></md>
Therefore, both <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> divide <m>c_1 - c_2</m>. Consequently,
<m>c_2 \equiv c_1 \pmod{mn}</m>.

<theorem>
<title>Chinese Remainder Theorem</title>
<statement>
<p><index><main>Chinese Remainder Theorem</main><sub>for integers</sub></index>
Let <m>n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k</m> be positive integers such that $\gcd(n_i, n_j)
= 1<m> for </m>i \neq j<m>. Then for any integers </m>a_1, \ldots, a_k$, the
system

 &amp;  \vdots </mrow><mrow>
x &amp; \equiv  a_k \pmod{n_k}
</mrow></md>
has a solution.  Furthermore, any two solutions of the system are
congruent modulo <m>n_1 n_2 \cdots n_k</m>.
</p>
FIXME-MOVE-IN-PROOF</statement>
</theorem>
 
<proof><p>
We will use mathematical induction on the number of equations in the
system. If there are <m>k= 2</m> equations, then the theorem is true by 
Lemma<nbsp /><xref ref="rings:chinese_remainder_lemma" />. Now suppose that the result is true for a system of <m>k</m> 
equations or less and that we wish to find a solution of 
<md><mrow>
x &amp; \equiv  a_1 \pmod{n_1}</mrow><mrow>
x &amp; \equiv  a_2 \pmod{n_2}</mrow><mrow>
  &amp; \vdots </mrow><mrow>
x &amp; \equiv  a_{k+1} \pmod{n_{k+1}}.
</mrow></md>
Considering the first <m>k</m> equations, there exists a solution that is
unique modulo <m>n_1 \cdots n_k</m>, say <m>a</m>. Since <m>n_1 \cdots n_k</m> and
<m>n_{k+1}</m> are relatively prime, the system 
<md><mrow>
x &amp; \equiv  a \pmod{n_1 \cdots n_k }</mrow><mrow>
x &amp; \equiv  a_{k+1} \pmod{n_{k+1}}
</mrow></md>
has a solution that is unique modulo <m>n_1 \ldots n_{k+1}</m> by the
lemma.
</p></proof>
 
 
<example xml:id="system_mod4or5">
<p>
Let us solve the system
<md><mrow>
x &amp; \equiv  3 \pmod{4}</mrow><mrow>
x &amp; \equiv  4 \pmod{5}</mrow><mrow>
x &amp; \equiv  1 \pmod{9}</mrow><mrow>
x &amp; \equiv  5 \pmod{7}. 
</mrow></md>
From Example \ref{example:rings:solve_system} we know that 19 is a solution of the first two
congruences and any other solution of the system is congruent to $19
\pmod{20}$. Hence, we can reduce the system to a system of three 
congruences:
<md><mrow>
x &amp; \equiv  19 \pmod{20}</mrow><mrow>
x &amp; \equiv  1 \pmod{9}</mrow><mrow>
x &amp; \equiv  5 \pmod{7}. 
</mrow></md>
Solving the next two equations, we can reduce the system to
<md><mrow>
x &amp; \equiv  19 \pmod{180}</mrow><mrow>
x &amp; \equiv  5 \pmod{7}. 
</mrow></md>
Solving this last system, we find that 19 is a solution for the system
that is unique up to modulo 1260.

One interesting application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem in the
design of computer software is that the theorem allows us to break up
a calculation involving large integers into several less formidable
calculations. Most computers will handle integer calculations only up
to a certain size.  For example, the largest integer available on many
workstations is <m>2^{31} - 1 = \mbox{2,147,483,647}</m>.  Special
software is required for calculations involving larger integers which 
cannot be added directly by the machine.  However, by using the Chinese
Remainder Theorem we can break down large integer additions and
multiplications into calculations that the computer can handle
directly. This is especially useful on parallel processing computers
which have the ability to
run several programs concurrently. 
 
Most computers have a single central
processing unit (CPU), which can only add two numbers at a time. To add 
a list of ten numbers, the CPU must do nine additions
in sequence. However, a parallel processing computer has more than
one CPU. A computer with 10 CPUs, for example,  can perform 10
different additions at the same time. If we can take a large integer 
and break
it down into parts, sending each part to a different CPU, then by
performing several additions or multiplications
simultaneously on those parts, we can work with an integer that the
computer would not be able to handle as a whole.  
 
 
<example xml:id="ring2134">
<p>
Suppose that we wish to multiply 2134 by 1531. We will use the integers
95, 97, 98, and 99 because they are relatively prime. We can break down
each integer into four parts:
<md><mrow>
2134 &amp; \equiv  44 \pmod{95}</mrow><mrow>
2134 &amp; \equiv  0 \pmod{97}</mrow><mrow>
2134 &amp; \equiv  76 \pmod{98}</mrow><mrow>
2134 &amp; \equiv  55 \pmod{99} 
</mrow></md>
and
<md><mrow>
1531 &amp; \equiv  11 \pmod{95}</mrow><mrow>
1531 &amp; \equiv  76 \pmod{97}</mrow><mrow>
1531 &amp; \equiv  61 \pmod{98}</mrow><mrow>
1531 &amp; \equiv  46 \pmod{99}. 
</mrow></md>
Multiplying the corresponding equations, we obtain
<md><mrow>
2134 \cdot 1531 &amp; \equiv  44 \cdot 11  \equiv  9 \pmod{95}</mrow><mrow>
2134 \cdot 1531 &amp; \equiv  0  \cdot 76  \equiv  0 \pmod{97}</mrow><mrow>
2134 \cdot 1531 &amp; \equiv  76 \cdot 61  \equiv  30 \pmod{98}</mrow><mrow>
2134 \cdot 1531 &amp; \equiv  55 \cdot 46  \equiv 55 \pmod{99}. 
</mrow></md>
Each of these four computations can be sent to a different processor
if our computer has several CPUs. By the above calculation, we know
that \mbox{<m>2134 \cdot 1531</m>} is a solution of the system
<md><mrow>
x &amp; \equiv  9 \pmod{95}</mrow><mrow>
x &amp; \equiv  0 \pmod{97}</mrow><mrow>
x &amp; \equiv  30 \pmod{98}</mrow><mrow>
x &amp; \equiv  55 \pmod{99}. 
</mrow></md>
The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that solutions are unique up to
modulo <m>95 \cdot 97 \cdot 98 \cdot 99 = \mbox{89,403,930}</m>. Solving
this system of congruences for <m>x</m> tells us that $2134 \cdot 1531 =
\mbox{3,267,154}$.  
 
 
The conversion of the computation into the four subcomputations will
take some computing time.  In addition, solving the system of
congruences can also take considerable time.  However, if we have
many computations to be performed on a particular set of numbers, it
makes sense to transform the problem as we have done above and to perform
the necessary calculations simultaneously.
