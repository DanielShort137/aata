The following exercises are less about cosets and subgroups, and more about using Sage as an experimental tool.  We will have many opportunities to work with cosets and subgroups in the coming chapters.\par
%
These exercises do not contain much guidance, and get more challenging as they go.  They are designed to explore, or confirm, results presented in this chapter.  Generally, they can be each be answered with a single (complicated) line of Sage that concludes by outputting \verb?True?.

\sageexercise{1}%
Use \verb?.subgroups()? to find an example of a group $G$ and an integer $m$, so that (a) $m$ divides the order of $G$, and (b) $G$ has no subgroup of order $m$.  (Do not use the group $A_4$ for $G$, since this is in the text.)  Provide just enough output to convince the reader that your example is correct.  Here is a very simple example that might help you structure the logic of a one-line verification.
%
\begin{sageexample}
sage: a = 5
sage: b = 10
sage: c = 6
sage: d = 13
sage: a.divides(b)
True
sage: not (b in [c,d])
True
sage: a.divides(b) and not (b in [c,d])
True
\end{sageexample}

\sageexercise{2}%
Verify the truth of Fermat's Little Theorem (either variant) for your own choice of a single number for the base $a$ (or $b$), and for $p$ assuming the value of every prime number between $100$ and $1000$.  Build up a solution slowly --- make a list of powers (start with just a few primes), then make a list of powers reduced by modular arithmetic, then a list of comparisons with  the predicted value, then a check on all these logical values resulting from the comparisons.  Eventually you can write a single line that performs the verification by eventually printing out \verb?True?.  Some more hints about useful functions follow below.
%
\begin{sageexample}
sage: a = 20
sage: b = 6
sage: a.mod(b)
2
sage: prime_range(50, 100)
[53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
sage: all([True, True, True, True])
True
sage: all([True, True, False, True])
False
\end{sageexample}
%
\begin{sageverbatim}\end{sageverbatim}
%
\sageexercise{3}%
Verify that the group of units mod $n$ has order $n-1$ when $n$ is prime, again for all primes between $100$ and $1000$.  As before, your output should be simply \verb?True?, just once indicating that the statement about the order is true for all the primes examined.  As before, build up your solution slowly, and with a smaller range of primes in the beginning.
\begin{sageverbatim}\end{sageverbatim}
%
\sageexercise{4}%
Verify Euler's Theorem for all values of $n<100$ and for $a \leq n$.  This will require nested \verb?for? statements with a conditional.  Again, here's a small example that might be helpful.
%
\begin{sageexample}
sage: [a/b for a in srange(9) for b in srange(1,a) if gcd(a,b)==1]
[2, 3, 3/2, 4, 4/3, 5, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6, 6/5,
 7, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4, 7/5, 7/6, 8, 8/3, 8/5, 8/7]
\end{sageexample}
