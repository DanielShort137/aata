\sageexercise{1}%
Build every subgroup of the alternating group on 5 symbols, $A_5$, and check that each is not a normal subgroup (except for the two trivial cases).  Running this check may take a minute or two --- be patient.  Compare this with the time needed to run the \verb?.is_simple()? method and realize that there is a significant amount of theory and cleverness brought to bear in speeding up commands like this.

\sageexercise{2}%
Use the \verb?coset_product? function to determine the Cayley table for the quotient group of the example of the group of symmetries of an 8-gon, and the cyclic subgroup of order 4 generated by a quarter-turn.  Use the number of each coset, as produced by the \verb?.cosets()? method as names for the elements of the quotient group.  You will need to build the table ``by hand'' as there is no easy way to have Sage's Cayley table command do this one for you.

\sageexercise{3}%
Consider  the cyclic subgroup of order $4$ in the symmetries of an 8-gon.  Verify that the subgroup is normal by first building the raw left and right cosets and then checking their equality in Sage with a single command.
\begin{sageverbatim}\end{sageverbatim}

\sageexercise{4}%
Again, use the same cyclic subgroup of order $4$ in the group of symmetries of an 8-gon.  Check that the subgroup is normal by using part (3) of Theorem~\extref{normal:normalequivalents}{10.1}{normal equivalences}.  You should be able to construct a one-line command that does the complete check and returns \verb?True?.  Maybe sort the elements of the subgroup \verb?S? first, then slowly build up the necessary lists, commands, and conditions in steps.  Notice that this check does not require ever building the cosets.
\begin{sageverbatim}\end{sageverbatim}

\sageexercise{5}%
Repeat the demonstration above that for the symmetries of a tetrahedron, the cyclic subgroup of order 3  results in an undefined coset multiplication.  Above, the default setting for the \verb?.cosets()? method built right cosets --- in this problem, work instead with left cosets.  You need to choose two cosets to multiply, and then demonstrate two choices for representatives that lead to different results for the product of the cosets.

\sageexercise{6}%
Construct some dihedral groups of order $2n$ (i.e.\ symmetries of an $n$-gon, $D_{2n}$ in the text, \verb?DihedralGroup(n)? in Sage).  Maybe for say $2\leq n \leq 30$.  For each dihedral group, construct a list of the orders of each of the normal subgroups (so use \verb?.normal_subgroups()?).  Observe enough examples to hypothesize a pattern to your observations, check your hypothesis against each of your examples and then state your hypothesis clearly.
