<p>This text is free to download, but if you are doing more than just browsing, then purchasing a print copy is less expensive than printing it on a laser printer, less expensive than a single copy (unbound) at a copy shop, and very close to prices charged by copy shops when ordering multiple copies at a discount.  Before ordering, you might want to examine an <a href="download.html">evaluation copy</a>.</p>

<p>A nicely printed and bound (hardback) copy of AATA can be purchased from Amazon.com for $18.95 via the link below.  This is a service provided by <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~lmitchell2/index.html">Lon Mitchell</a> and <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~clarson/">Craig Larson</a> of Virginia Commonwealth University, as part of their series of open-source textbooks made available print-on-demand.  The author, while supportive of this edition, is not involved directly in any way, including financially.  Small profits from these sales support the VCU textbook series of quality affordable mathematics textbooks.</p>

<p>A note about editions: This print-on-demand edition was built Summer 2009 and will possibly be updated Summer 2011 (though this is not clear as of 2011/08/10).  There have been some discrepancies in chapter numbering across editions.  This print-on-demand version starts with Chapter 1, as does the 2011 Annual Edition.  (The original, and some subsequent editions, started with Chapter 0.)  Also, the print-on-demand version lacks highlighted inline definitions.</p>

<p>Additionally, the chapter on normal subgroups and homomorphisms has now been split into two chapters, as of the 2010 Annual Edition.</p>
