<p>This text is free to download, but if you are doing more than just browsing, then purchasing a print copy is less expensive than printing it on a laser printer, less expensive than a single copy (unbound) at a copy shop, and very close to prices charged by copy shops when ordering multiple copies at a discount.  Before ordering, you might want to examine an <a href="download.html">evaluation copy</a>.</p>

<p><b>NOTE (2015-08-23): Be certain to read the note below about changes made in the 2015 Annual edition before purchasing an older hard copy, new or used.</b></p>

<!-- <p><b>NOTE (2016-08-15):</b> You can find hardback copies of the 2015 Annual Edition of AATA for sale at various online book merchants.  But the <b>2016 Annual Edition</b> should be available shortly, so you may want to wait a few days.  Once we get an ISBN number, we will include it here.</p> -->

<h3>A Note About Editions</h3>

<p>There have been some discrepancies in numbering in earlier editions as the open source version has evolved and improved.
<ol>
	<li>The 2015 Edition has many non-trivial changes to numbers of theorems, examples, figures, etc. within each chapter.  Chapter numbers are unchanged.  We also intend that the numbering of the exercises remains unchanged (but instructors may wish to verify their existing problem lists).</li>
	<li>For the 2011 Edition, a chapter on normal subgroups and homomorphisms was split into two new chapters, affecting the numbering of later chapters.</li>
	<li>The 2009 print version lacks highlighting of some inline definitions.</li>
	<li>The orginal commercial version contained a Chapter 0, now numbering begins with Chapter 1.</li>
</ol>
