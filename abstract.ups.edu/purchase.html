<p>This text is free to download, but if you are doing more than just browsing, then purchasing a print copy is less expensive than printing it on a laser printer, less expensive than a single copy (unbound) at a copy shop, and very close to prices charged by copy shops when ordering multiple copies at a discount.  Before ordering, you might want to examine an <a href="download.html">evaluation copy</a>.</p>

<p>A nicely printed and bound (hardback) copy of AATA can be purchased from Amazon.com for $19.95 via the link below.  This is a service provided by <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~lmitchell2/index.html">Lon Mitchell</a>.  The author, while supportive of this edition, is not involved directly in any way, including financially.</p>

<p>A note about editions: There have been some discrepancies in chapter numbering across editions.  Both the print-on-demand versions start with Chapter 1, but the 2011 Edition contains a split of the chapter on normal subgroups and homomorphisms, so later chapters have new numbers.  The original text, and some subsequent PDF versions, started with Chapter 0.  The print-on-demand 2009 version lacks some highlighted inline definitions.</p>

<p>The now obsolete 2009 Edition will remain available through sometime in October 2011.</p>
