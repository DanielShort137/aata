<p>This text is free to download, but if you are doing more than just browsing, then purchasing a print copy is less expensive than printing it on a laser printer, less expensive than a single copy (unbound) at a copy shop, and very close to prices charged by copy shops when ordering multiple copies at a discount.  Before ordering, you might want to examine an <a href="download.html">evaluation copy</a>.</p>

<p><b>NOTE (2015/07/19):</b> The next paragraph describes the 2014 Annual Edition which will soon be replaced by a substantially improved 2015 Annual Edition.  Check back here for news on availability.</p>

<p>A nicely printed and bound (hardback) copy of the 2014 Edition of AATA can be purchased for around $25. It is available at your favorite online retailer or by special order from your local or college bookstore.  This is a service provided by <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~lmitchell2/index.html">Lon Mitchell</a> of <a href="http://orthogonalpublishing.com/">Orthogonal Publishing</a>.  The author, while supportive of this edition, is not involved directly in any way, including financially.  The ISBN for the 2014 Edition is:  <tt>9780989897549</tt>.</p>

<h3>A Note About Editions</h3>

<p>There have been some discrepancies in numbering in earlier editions as the open source version has evolved and improved.
<ol>
	<li>The 2015 Edition has non-trivial changes to numbers of theorems, examples, figures, etc. within each chapter.  We intend that the numbering of the exercises remains unchanged.</li>
	<li>For the 2011 Edition, a chapter on normal subgroups and homomorphisms was split into two new chapters, affecting the numbering of later chapters.</li>
	<li>The 2009 print version lacks highlighting of some inline definitions.</li>
	<li>The orginal commercial version contained a Chapter 0, now numbering begins with Chapter 1.</li>
</ol>
