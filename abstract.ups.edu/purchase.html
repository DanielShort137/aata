<p>This text is free to download, but if you are doing more than just browsing, then purchasing a print copy is less expensive than printing it on a laser printer, less expensive than a single copy (unbound) at a copy shop, and very close to prices charged by copy shops when ordering multiple copies at a discount.  Before ordering, you might want to examine an <a href="download.html">evaluation copy</a>.</p>

<p>A nicely printed and bound (hardback) copy of AATA can be purchased from Amazon.com for $17.95 via the link below.  This is a service provided by <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~lmitchell2/index.html">Lon Mitchell</a> and <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~clarson/">Craig Larson</a> of Virginia Commonwealth University, as part of their series of open-source textbooks made available print-on-demand.  The author, while supportive of this edition, is not involved directly in any way, including financially.  Small profits from these sales support the VCU textbook series of quality affordable mathematics textbooks.</p>

<p>A note about editions: This print-on-demand edition was built Summer 2009 and will likely be next updated Summer 2011.  It most closely resembles the 2009 PDF (dated February 14, 2009), with two exceptions - chapter numbering starts at 0 in the PDF and at 1 in the printed book, and in the book the inline definitions are not highlighted in a different font.  Future PDFs and printed books will start chapter numbering at 1, but about halfway through one chapter has been cleaved into two, further affecting numbering in the latter half of the book.</p>
