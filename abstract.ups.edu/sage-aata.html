<p><a href="http://sagemath.org"  target=_blank>Sage</a> is an open-source program for doing mathematics and is the ideal companion to <span class="bookname">Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications</span>.  Sage is designed to be a free, open source alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica and Matlab.   It includes many mature and powerful <a href="http://sagemath.org/links-components.html" target=_blank>open-source tools for mathematics</a>, such as <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~gap/" target=_blank>GAP</a> for group theory.  With a strength in number theory, Sage also has excellent support for rings and fields.</p>

<!-- Missing exercises: struct, matrix, domains -->
<p>Rob Beezer has contributed extensive material about studying abstract algebra concepts with Sage, and instruction in the use of Sage itself.  Each chapter (except one, <q>Matrix Groups and Symmetry</q>) has an extensive discussion of how to profitably use Sage.  For most chapters (except two), these discussions are followed by classroom-tested exercises, ranging from very computational to open-ended guided explorations.  In total there are 710 examples of Sage code and 121 exercises.  These examples are run through automated testing every six months with the latest version of Sage, so are highly reliable.</p>

<p>All of this material is included in the <a href="aata">online version</a>, where the Sage examples are executable and editable, via the free Sage Cell server.  The PDF download below is a static version of the online version and includes all the Sage material, where the examples have sample output included.</p>

<p><b>Note (2015-08-16)</b>: Work is underway to provide the Sage material in more formats than just the <a href="aata">online version</a> and the PDF below.  Check back here for more.</p>

<!-- <p>Available here is an electronic version of the text in the Sage worksheet format.  This version of the text has been supplemented with significant discussion for each chapter about the use of Sage for the topic at-hand.  This discussion is followed by a selection of exercises.  If you are curious about the nature or scope of this supplement, download the PDF version of just the supplemental material, but understand that in the worksheet version the code is executable and editable.  The "exercises only" version is designed for students who will be submitting the exercises as worksheets and do not want all the text.  Be sure to read the notes below.</p> -->

<!-- <h3>Notes</h3>
<ol>
<li>NB: Production of the Sage worksheets is broken for the 2014 edition.  The 2013 worksheets are not substantially different.  Work is underway to bring these back for the 2015 edition of the book.</li>
<li>Download the collections of worksheets as a zip file to your local storage.  Then use the Sage notebook upload function to upload the entire zip file - the notebook will unzip it for you.  If Safari unzips the file automatically, look in the trash for the original zip file.</li>
<li>You can use a free notebook server by making an account at <a href="http://sagenb.org/">sagenb.org</a>.</li>
<li>Links do not work between worksheets as the Sage notebook does not support this yet.  In particular, tables of contents will not be useful.  Just open the chapters you want to read.</li>
<li>If you have lots of Sage worksheets already, these may unzip into your notebook in the vicinity of worksheets you last used in August 2012, so look there if you do not see them, or sort your worksheets on a different column.</li>
<li>Examples have all been tested for accuracy with the Sage doctest framework using Sage Version 5.11.</li>
<li>In the Sage worksheets that duplicate the content of the text, there are many malformed hypertext links (like <a href="graphics/links-in-notebook.png">this</a>).  We know about it and are working on it.
<li>Like the text itself, this material is licensed with a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html" target=_blank>GNU Free Documentation License</a>.</li>

<p>There was once a <a href="http://buzzard.ups.edu/sage/sage-group-theory-primer.pdf">tutorial</a> here, and we have left the PDF available.  It is now obsolete and is no longer being maintained.
